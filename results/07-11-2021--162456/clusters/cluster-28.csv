"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,0.03291760350212281
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,0.04179570049862155
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.045695559613143186
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,9813516,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37351,0.029785794868975746
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,0.05365035704418778
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9989900,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM).

"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10053237,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2020,67626,0.0366415822738452
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9962148,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2020,69926,0.024022611481671022
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10115288,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2020,99860,0.011172676814262567
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,0.010692494375794987
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10019696,R33MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular injury']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2020,191801,0.02466747120763223
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9973236,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,194584,0.010907898973684263
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,0.03969149123626808
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,0.020985946607292028
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,237101,-0.02805352995844685
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,0.029908832406196226
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,-0.0026993403126332645
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10156737,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2020,249000,0.030543414825561166
"Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT) Project Summary/Abstract  The idiosyncrasies of the human brain require that individualized mapping of functional regions be performed before surgical interventions for cancer or epilepsy. The success of this mapping procedure has direct effects on surgical outcomes and preserving cognitive and sensory function post-surgery. Current gold standard procedures for pre-surgical mapping are invasive, time-consuming, and technically demanding. Several non-invasive procedures have emerged in recent years; however, they have not yet displaced the gold standard procedures. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI), the most widely used non-invasive pre-surgical mapping technique, requires that patients perform cognitive or motor tasks while in the scanner—a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Also, not all patients can perform fMRI tasks due to language barriers, sensory deficits, being unconscious, etc. Connectome Fingerprinting (CF) is a recently developed technique that uses machine learning to train a model capable of predicting functional brain activation from task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Once trained on a set of t-fMRI and rs- fMRI data, an unseen subject's unique pattern of brain activation can be predicted using only an rs-fMRI scan of their brain—therefore eliminating the need to perform tasks during the fMRI scan. Despite the promise of CF, the accuracy of the current best practice modeling techniques is not high enough yet to be clinically useful and studies applying CF have nearly always used healthy populations. Much research remains to be done to increase the accuracy of CF models before they can be deployed for pre-surgical mapping.  The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to develop a software application that combines applied machine learning with medical imaging to provide a non-invasive means for mapping the brains of neurosurgical patients before surgery. Importantly, we aim to increase the accuracy of CF modeling by expanding the modeling efforts to probabilistic Bayesian approaches that leverage prior information from the structure of the data. We will test a wide array of tunable data and model parameters to arrive at a current recommendation for best practices in CF research and applications. Finally, we will test our modeling procedures with a dataset of healthy control and pre-surgical patients diagnosed with brain tumors. We will test the software's ability to accurately predict functional brain organization in these patients and adaptively retrain the models to produce the most accurate results. This work has the potential to revolutionize pre-surgical brain mapping and expand its applicability to a greater number of patients. Project Narrative  In the United States, approximately 24,000 new cases of brain tumors are reported each year, with many patients requiring expensive pre-surgical planning and mapping of functional regions to minimize post-surgical impairments. In many neurosurgical practices [96% per 1], this involves performing a time-consuming and costly task-based fMRI acquisitions (nearly $1200/scan in 2014; [2]) before surgery to identify eloquent brain areas recruited for motor control, language, and cognition that must be spared during surgery. By combing task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI and advanced machine learning to map the functional topology of the brain, the proposed technology will lower pre-surgical planning costs, reduce the burden on physicians and technicians, and expand pre-surgical mapping to previously excluded patients who cannot perform fMRI tasks.",Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT),10139299,R43NS117226,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Software Engineering', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data quality', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'large scale data', 'motor control', 'multisensory', 'next generation', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'usability']",NINDS,"CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,252569,0.03252190862961411
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10050798,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,373940,0.06272541370770272
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,0.030349534016845446
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9949794,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,385524,0.008040672713317161
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,0.03320138218852079
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges. An open collection of neural network tools will facilitate scientific communities and has the potential to accelerate scientific discoveries about the nervous system. https://docs.google.com/document/d/11s9ZRzy8tHs6NguzpnJdJUWRgLvdkXpEYjZchtJXSmY/edit# 2/23",Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers,10021957,RF1MH121885,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Longevity', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cognitive development', 'college', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'diverse data', 'high school', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'software infrastructure', 'statistical learning', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2020,419908,0.028348909030699938
"Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data Project Summary The broad objective of this research is to develop a powerful deep-learning based multiple testing approach for high-dimensional spatial data that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies, in particular, brain imaging studies. The motivating problem is to detect the cerebral metabolic abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data. Existing multiple testing approaches in solving this problem often ignore or inadequately capture the spatial dependence among the test statistics obtained from brain voxels and thus lose substantial power for the detection. We will develop a novel spatial multiple testing method that utilizes the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a key deep- learning technique, to well capture the spatial dependence among test statistics and thus to achieve the optimal power in the sense of minimizing the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while correctly controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given level. The proposed DCNN-based FDR controlling method has enhanced power to discover new AD-related brain regions that are missed by conventional methods, thereby leading to novel clinical and pathological studies. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. To develop an optimal spatial FDR controlling approach by connecting the unsupervised local-significance-index based multiple testing with the supervised DCNN-based image segmentation; 2. To evaluate the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach via extensive simulations under various three-dimensional spatial dependence structures, in comparison with multiple classical and state-of-the-art methods; 3. To apply proposed spatial FDR controlling approach to detect AD-related brain regions using the FDG-PET datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Weill Cornell Brain Health Imaging Institute; 4. To develop a user- friendly and publicly available software package with versions in both Python and R to implement the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach. The proposed DCNN-based approach will also be widely applicable to large- scale multiple testing problems in other fields of biomedical research that involve spatial dependence. Project Narrative This project will exploit recent advances in deep learning to efficiently solve the large-scale spatial multiple testing problems that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies. The proposed powerful deep-learning based spatial multiple testing approach will be particularly useful in brain imaging studies on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive impairment.",Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data,10107565,R21AG070303,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Fluorine', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Group', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain health', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'metabolic rate', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'repository', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,435875,-0.04025532153953057
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,0.041832810396928995
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focuses on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10139715,R42MH118845,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'HIV', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data access', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic rate', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodegenerative dementia', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'regional difference', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'software infrastructure', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'usability', 'web app', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2020,456359,0.010521132403533914
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,-0.028131722135480434
"Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging Healthy older adults (HOA) confront complex and life-changing decisions in the face of declining neural resources. Changes in aged brains include shrinkage of neurons and their projections in several areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra.1 These age-related structural brain changes, typically measured using in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI), reflect cellular changes. Glutamate (Glu) is a key molecule in cellular metabolism, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, and the principal neurotransmitter of cortical efferents.2,3 Alterations in brain Glu likely contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in behavioral and cognitive functions.4 Yet, only a few studies4-11 have investigated age-related changes in brain Glu, in vivo, during healthy aging. Most of these have used standard techniques and as a result our understanding of the role that brain Glu has in typical and atypical aging remains limited. Here, I aim to fill significant gaps in the field, by 1) assessing brain Glu using a novel magnetization transfer technique—Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST)—on an ultra-high field 7T MRI scanner, enables the measurement of brain Glu across the cerebrum in humans.12; 2) assess cognitive performance using a highly sensitive computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)); and 3) explore the possibility of aging biotypes based upon age- related changes in brain glutamate.  Here, we propose to investigate alterations in brain glutamate in 100 HOA (60-85 years of age) using GluCEST 7T MRI and relate alterations in brain Glu to age-related changes in cognitive functioning, including, memory, and executive function. Moreover, we will contrast age-related patterns with data from young adults (18-30 years of age). Finally, we leverage data from a large consortium, iSTAGING (directed by Co- Investigator Davatzikos), to employ recently developed machine-learning techniques (e.g. HYDRA13), to classify subgroups of older adults based upon unique patterns of brain structure associated with typical, atypical and resilient aging. These subtypes will be applied within our sample and patterns of brain glutamate can then be measured within these subtypes. The proposed studies will provide more specific and sensitive in vivo measurements of brain glutamate in HOA. This proposal will enable testing of specific hypothesis about the regional distribution of brain Glu, its relation to aging, and its contribution to cognitive functioning in aging. As such, these studies can provide crucial preliminary data for longitudinal studies in healthy and pathological aging by targeting a specific neural mechanism associated with cognition and disease progression. RELEVANCE Older adults tend to focus on positive emotional information more than their younger counterparts. The psychological and neural mechanisms of this positivity bias remain unclear and it is possible that an age-related reduction in executive function contribute to this bias. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the positivity bias is maintained in those at risk for developing dementia. This positivity and and  roject aims to characterize this emergence of this bias across the lifespan and determine its role in the early stages of dementia those at risk for developing dementia using computerized assessment of emotion cognition. p",Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging,10241606,R56AG066656,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain size', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'executive function', 'frontal lobe', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pathological aging', 'psychologic', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2020,532865,0.02724826407539922
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,9971052,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,533173,-0.03323826323648893
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9914136,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,540520,0.018837515561766757
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.044042046382193216
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,0.037769070738775
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9828783,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,555799,0.036606456709100246
"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,-0.007004000340356844
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,10006884,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,575750,0.0220150209392499
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in combination with anatomical MRI and intracranial EEG data.",BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging,9894648,R01EB026299,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Institution', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cloud storage', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'cortex mapping', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'data structure', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'graphical user interface', 'hands on instruction', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'magnetic field', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,633469,0.03173747878746831
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,9995177,R01MH060974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Callithrix', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injections', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'anatomical tracing', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'denoising', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,650574,0.022373540682337253
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.04181680337206264
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,0.017127658034652757
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,10001025,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,724789,0.03576388928286685
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9978131,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,787558,0.016168697910345715
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis.

"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9988322,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,832266,-0.004629992501773224
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,0.03951743246900157
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,9985547,R01MH121411,"['Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'causal model', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'longitudinal course', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'white matter']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,839437,-0.006819127920326355
"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods. The results will deepen our knowledge of brain function and dysfunction and will pave the way for the development of new methods to diagnose and treat brain disorders.",Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction,10008042,RF1MH123192,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'cognitive process', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,839700,0.06584050094770384
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10055446,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,852784,-0.033073260640218066
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,0.050710788977531764
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes.

"Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols Project summary: The main objectives of this project are to perform longitudinal collection of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from a cohort of adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls; and to develop a set of analytical tools that can be used to study the developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in this population. The project builds on the ongoing collaboration of our team in a Connectomes Related to Human Disease U01 project, the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA) study, where we have been performing extensive clinical characterization and MRI scanning with Human Connectome Project (HCP) protocols on adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. These baseline data (current total: N=170; final target: N=225) are set to become available publicly through the HCP database. Here we propose to collect longitudinal data on this unique, thoroughly characterized cohort. Following up on these subjects will allow us to investigate the complex relationship between longitudinal changes in neural circuitry and the onset, persistence, or recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders. We will tackle this by bringing together an investigative team with strong expertise in adolescent mood disorders and in neuroimaging data analysis. The MPIs have extensive experience in developing publicly available software tools for the analysis of brain connections from diffusion MRI (Yendiki) and functional MRI (Whitfield-Gabrieli). In this project, we propose to develop robust, automated tools for segmenting deep-brain structures and white-matter pathways that are of interest in psychiatric disorders. This development will build on our prior work in unbiased methods for longitudinal morphometric and tractography analyses. We will leverage the proposed longitudinal dataset and tools for accurate delineation of individual anatomy to perform a number of novel analyses that will go beyond conventional group-wise comparisons. Specifically, we will focus on analyses that allow us to predict clinical outcomes in individual subjects based on their neural circuitry. We will use machine-learning techniques to map the normative developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in healthy adolescents, including our controls and those from the development HCP. We will then investigate how and when the trajectories of individual adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders deviate from this normative trajectory. The longitudinal data set that we will collect and the software tools that we will develop will be shared with the research community. Our analysis methods will be applicable beyond this cohort, and could be used to study disease mechanisms and predict outcomes in a wide range of brain-related disorders across the human lifespan. Project narrative: This project will follow up on a cohort of adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls to collect clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data over time. Depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed during adolescence predict negative long-term consequences in adulthood. Clarifying the neural circuitry that contributes to the onset, persistence, and recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders is a key step towards developing novel biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, as well as novel treatment targets for more effective therapeutics.",Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols,10057408,R56MH121426,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Interview', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'age group', 'analytical tool', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'child depression', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'connectome', 'data quality', 'disease mechanisms study', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'human data', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2020,1225770,0.010428333915770013
"Mapping human brain perivascular space in lifespan using human connectome project data PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular spaces are a critical component of the glia-lymphatic circuit, facilitating the clearance of soluble waste. The role of perivascular spaces and changes in the brain’s clearance system in normal development, aging, and cognition is not fully understood, mainly due to lack of neuroimaging capabilities. However, noninvasive in vivo mapping of the perivascular space fluid with high accuracy and reliability is now made possible with our recent analytical developments, using human connectome project (HCP) data. The objective of this project is to map structural and diffusion features of perivascular space fluid across lifespan. PVS features include PVS presence (e.g., count and volume fraction) and diffusion (e.g., diffusivity and anisotropy). These features will be extracted regionally and globally across the brain. Structural MRI will provide information regarding localization and extent of the PVS and diffusion MRI will be used to investigate biophysical properties of the PVS fluid and surrounding tissue. The central hypothesis is that the perivascular space fluid increases across lifespan. We also hypothesize that individual differences exist in perivascular spaces as a function of demographic, general health and lifestyle health choices, such as body mass index, blood pressure, tobacco use and sleep quality. The central hypothesis will be tested by characterizing the normative map of the perivascular space fluid across the lifespan and in relation to various demographic, cognitive measures, and health factors. We will also examine whether subjects neuro-behavioral performances can be predicted by perivascular space features. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques that we recently developed and optimized on HCP data. We will also use Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Studies to build first normative template of PVS in neurodevelopment. Together, our findings will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the human brain clearance system, and our shared perivascular space mapping workflow can provide a resource for researchers to study a wide range of neurological conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to fill our gap knowledge regarding the role of the clearance system in brain health and cognition and its neuroimaging signature. We will identify and provide access to quantitative morphological and diffusion features of brain glia-lymphatic network to the larger scientific community to help facilitate our understanding of what role the brain clearance system has across lifespan.

"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,1506851,-0.03794375966859466
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. We propose here to pioneer the development of next-generation, vascularized brain organoids and to apply novel, scalable molecular and imaging tools to enable investigation of human neural circuits in health and disease.",High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids,10049677,RF1MH123977,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epitopes', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cell type', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'information processing', 'materials science', 'model design', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'synaptic pruning']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2509021,0.05184390948399334
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10018624,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,3035766,-0.015726311789147147
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,0.03291760350212281
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.045695559613143186
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.03335380513460248
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9765040,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9832833,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2019,65854,0.024022611481671022
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,0.016886761259902187
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,0.043203114867022836
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2.

"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9822873,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2019,192500,0.010907898973684263
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,0.03969149123626808
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9788528,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,207338,0.02466747120763223
"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,0.02656542849840264
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.029908832406196226
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, this proposal develops an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world.",GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN,9999721,R00EY028229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Neuromechanics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'area MST', 'area MT', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromechanism', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treadmill', 'treatment planning', 'visual control', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-motor integration']",NEI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,-0.03649526022313189
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,0.020985946607292028
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the longitudinal structural data we are already analyzing. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for the longitudinal structural imaging data of Aim 2. Longitudinal imaging data are particularly significant, as any differences we find in the evolution of brain structure over time across subgroups supports the notion that the subgroups have distinct natural histories, which in turn goes a long way towards the provocative conclusion that these subgroups of “Alzheimer's disease” represent distinct conditions. Machine learning approaches to these data were not envisioned in the initial proposal, but represent a particularly valuable complementary approach that may identify similarities and differences in trajectories of the evolution of brain structure that would not be apparent using the more traditional analytic pipelines we outlined in the proposal. This then is the perfect fit for an Administrative Supplement – this is an opportunity to enhance the value of the parent study by adding new expertise to investigate in a complementary and valuable fashion a question that was already addressed by the parent grant. This Supplement builds on the same infrastructure and questions asked in Aim 2, but augments our analytical armamentarium with novel machine learning approaches. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672,  'ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups. This proposal would add machine learning approaches for the longitudinal structural imaging data to the analytic strategies already being pursued by the investigators.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9787575,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2019,291536,0.011172676814262567
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,-0.0026993403126332645
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,0.030349534016845446
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9688607,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,385524,0.008040672713317161
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,0.03320138218852079
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,0.03833895527866102
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,0.030398530769838828
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,0.041832810396928995
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,0.040144767320692665
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9712424,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,540520,0.018837515561766757
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis.

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9606512,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,570175,0.036606456709100246
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,9803682,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,575750,0.0220150209392499
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data.

"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9736791,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,661398,0.009889681289698225
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,0.04181680337206264
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,0.03576388928286685
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9838618,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,795608,0.016168697910345715
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,0.017127658034652757
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,0.03951743246900157
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9817776,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,891796,-0.004629992501773224
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,0.050710788977531764
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants.

"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,9917201,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,2825827,-0.015726311789147147
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.03419253640717638
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9615336,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,21194,0.03291760350212281
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'stimulant use', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,0.028271092052709803
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9507688,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2018,28735,0.029576541803134657
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.045695559613143186
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9559419,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2018,36505,0.017919116202980444
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9534942,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,36594,0.03335380513460248
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.0291267178939189
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9545566,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Screening', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,44524,0.011793093669779368
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,-0.003234185909190714

"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,0.016886761259902187
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,0.03192612895268751
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9523223,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144298,0.03333012108136259
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence.

"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,-0.017853350581927267
"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,0.02656542849840264
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,0.03969149123626808
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,206809,0.02466747120763223
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,0.039335660038418784
"ADNI Psychometrics: fcMRI and Machine Learning Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the structural data we are already analyzing, and adds analyses of functional data we had not previously been planning to analyze. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for Aim 2. The new functional data analyses incorporate measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data from resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data collected by ADNI. Those data enable the characterization of functional connectivity. There are many levels of correlation in the analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data, and another talented faculty member in Radiology has specific expertise in analyzing these data (T Madhyastha). Dr. Madhyastha will supervise analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data from the cognitively-defined subgroups of Aim 2, which will provide important additional information regarding whether the functional connectivity patterns of people in these subgroups are similar to or different from each other.

"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9679722,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2018,303226,0.011172676814262567
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,0.05929239034821647
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care.

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9471432,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,385524,0.008040672713317161
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,-0.016106172271185836
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,-0.01309937700836938
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,0.03191877864888647
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,0.041832810396928995
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,0.030398530769838828
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical tool of its kind and find immediate application in clinical settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients.",Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes,9524766,R44AG054256,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Industry', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Wireless Technology', 'alertness', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic association', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurocognitive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'synucleinopathy', 'tool']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R44,2018,548140,-0.04441999885347433
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,0.040144767320692665
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9470490,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,554686,0.036606456709100246
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9594591,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,561118,0.037769070738775
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,0.03951743246900157
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.04181680337206264
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in combination with anatomical MRI and intracranial EEG data.",BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging,9533856,R01EB026299,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Institution', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cloud storage', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'cortex mapping', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'distributed data', 'electric field', 'graphical user interface', 'hands on instruction', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'magnetic field', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,678920,0.03173747878746831
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,0.009889681289698225
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30.

More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,-0.0013581021584012753
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,0.028271092052709803
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9395139,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2017,32309,0.029576541803134657
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9327290,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2017,35797,0.017919116202980444
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9396350,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,35844,0.03335380513460248
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9396432,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2017,44044,0.011793093669779368
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,-0.003234185909190714

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,0.03192612895268751
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,0.03333012108136259
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,-0.017853350581927267
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,0.043203114867022836
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,-0.014200082173352127
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,223908,0.041832810396928995
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9333297,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,328543,0.058943870599698654
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9325617,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,347813,0.004837867214390419
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9360120,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,378750,-0.03217956085789162
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9318580,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382414,0.008040672713317161
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,-0.016106172271185836
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,-0.01309937700836938
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,0.040144767320692665
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.04181680337206264
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process.

"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities.

Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher.

More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,0.03951743246900157

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,0.016886761259902187
"Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, Aβ deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions. Project narrative This proposal pools imaging data from 11 different studies, with a total of more than 10,000 individuals of ages 45 to 95, aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of brain aging. State of the art imaging harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning methods will be used to derive normative brain aging curves, and to characterize the heterogeneity of deviations from these curves in people with resilient and accelerated brain aging. Moreover, we aim to relate these imaging patterns to cognitive performance. We will eventually derive and “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), allowing us to place any individual's scans into a quantitative measurement system and plot his/her trajectories over time.","Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis",9211062,RF1AG054409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'care systems', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive performance', 'community burden', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'frontier', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pathological aging', 'predictive marker', 'quantitative imaging', 'resilience', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2017,3791182,-0.04253935174291527
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,0.04259355194617242
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,0.020011860579115626
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,0.03487269048951994
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,0.03192612895268751
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,0.03333012108136259
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness.

"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,-0.014200082173352127
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,0.009758353005466363

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9098673,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,326999,0.058943870599698654
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,0.03208673092625806
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9170673,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyped Behavior', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2016,377500,-0.03217956085789162
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,-0.016106172271185836
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,0.008040672713317161
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,-0.01309937700836938
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,0.030398530769838828
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,0.040144767320692665
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,9097801,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,562097,0.029978598438397383
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,0.012328810866480957
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,9055762,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'childhood cancer mortality', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,719743,0.00581602155467585
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.04181680337206264

"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,0.020011860579115626
"Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities.

The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8936370,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,70950,0.021375010131149348
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,0.03192612895268751
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,0.03333012108136259
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,0.009758353005466363
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge from the transcranial magnetic and electrical DC stimulation experiments may have translational applications for rehabilitation following brain injuries.                ",Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms,8946229,R01DC014736,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Music', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive process', 'cost shifting', 'fighting', 'image guided', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'prefrontal lobe', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2015,283560,0.024301571685434648
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,0.03208673092625806
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions. Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8822295,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'image guided', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,376478,0.006134011686453004
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,0.030398530769838828
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,-0.016106172271185836
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,-0.01309937700836938
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,0.012328810866480957
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths.

According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8843052,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,716624,0.00581602155467585

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,0.015333140248202235
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,0.021375010131149348
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,0.03333012108136259
"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,0.004837867214390419
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,0.05929239034821647
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8634100,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,376478,0.006134011686453004
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.            ",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8720479,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,566111,0.00581602155467585
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,0.012328810866480957
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.        Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey. These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain. We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments. The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine: One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma. The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.",Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses,8729873,R01EB003832,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laminectomy', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Ursidae Family', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arteriole', 'base', 'bone', 'brain cell', 'capillary', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second harmonic', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,812810,0.032619162575167636

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,0.02212526041794124
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.                ","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8527041,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2013,52190,0.015333140248202235
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8542895,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2013,232307,-0.018125144774969588
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8451290,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,364955,0.006134011686453004
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,0.029978598438397383
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,0.012328810866480957
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.        These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Agrammatism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Atrophic', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Functional Aphasias', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantic Dementias', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,0.01620401073474201
"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.              Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.        Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. With the development of appropriate analytical tools, multimodal functional brain imaging is in the process of revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, dementia, and epilepsy that affect tens of millions of Americans.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attrat our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.                  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,0.05282159846811904
"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.              These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.              Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,0.04365714959127415
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,0.011395893416272741
"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,0.055478043934421746
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7616408,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,35821,0.04365714959127415
"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,0.05282159846811904

Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7599700,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2009,216795,0.055478043934421746
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase.

"Massively Parallel Brain Imaging  I propose a disruptive technology that will revolutionize our understanding of brain function, development, and disease. Because the study of neural circuits remains deeply limited by a paucity of data, we need massively parallel approaches to brain imaging that will raise data acquisition rates by over two orders of magnitude. High-throughput technologies have already revolutionized certain areas of biology such as genomics and proteomics, but neuroscience has yet to experience a growth spurt of comparable magnitude. I will construct instrumentation allowing the brain volumes of ~100 alert flies to be imaged simultaneously by two-photon fluorescence microscopy. I have chosen the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, because of its small brain, its sophisticated behavioral repertoire, the large number of strains with genetically targeted alterations to brain circuitry, the utility of fluorescence imaging of neural activity in this species, and the importance of the fly as a model for the study of many brain diseases.  Massively parallel brain imaging will open entirely new avenues: 1) The ability to track neural dynamics across the brains of large numbers of normal flies and those with genetically induced neural circuit perturbations will revolutionize our understanding of how neural circuits produce animal behavior; 2) The now prominent role of the fruit fly as a model system for the study of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and addiction implies we will gain significant medical insights into devastating conditions; 3) Our technology will have important applications to drug screening, allowing the cellular effects of new compounds to be assessed rapidly in vivo; 4) The ability to perform high-throughput time-lapse imaging of cellular events during the maturation of fly embryos will allow an additional revolution in developmental neurobiology. Applications of our technology will also be plentiful in other model organisms such as nematodes and zebrafish, profoundly impacting multiple areas of biomedicine. n/a",Massively Parallel Brain Imaging,7683010,DP1OD003560,"['Ablation', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caliber', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Cornea', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dendrites', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Figs - dietary', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Invertebrates', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Larva', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleotides', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synchrotrons', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tea', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tube', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virion', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'age related', 'base', 'behavioral sensitization', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cocaine exposure', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'essays', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'light microscopy', 'light scattering', 'meetings', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'mouse genome', 'mutant', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurogenetics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'object motion', 'optical imaging', 'optical traps', 'practical application', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP1,2009,395000,0.04988376807306578

"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7663443,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2008,12825,0.025596375677298493
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,0.04365714959127415
"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7408288,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'concept', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2008,48739,0.011395893416272741
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.          n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7522303,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2008,868308,-0.025727523716855098
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,0.04365714959127415

"A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated single-trial system for neuroimaging which combines high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to use this system to investigate variability in neural processing. The high-temporal resolution of EEG will enable the detection of signal variability in single-trial events, and this information will be used as the input function for analysis of simultaneously acquired event-related fMRI (efMRl). We hypothesize that using single-trial EEG derived regressors for efMRI (stEEG/fMRI) will yield high spatial and high temporal resolution information about the functional neuroanatomy involved in cognitive processing. This will enable construction of unique EEG derived tMRI activation maps which are not based on pre-defined labels or observed behavioral responses but rather on task and subject specific electrophysiological source variability. The broad impact of this work will be development of a new non-invasive imaging system (stEEG/fMRI) for the cognitive neurosciences as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The R21 effort focuses on development of a high density (64 channels) EEG/fMRI integrated system for single-trial analysis, and characterization of possible differences between the EEG recorded in an MR environment and that recorded in a standard environment. The R33 will then demonstrate the use of stEEG/fMRI in a pilot study of cognitive aging. R21Aims: 1. Develop an in-magnet 64 channel EEG system for single-trial analysis of event-related potentials recorded concurrently with fMRI. 2. Assess the quality of EEG collected inside the MR scanner compared to that collected in a shielded EEG room, using a series of predefined protocols for characterizing the effects of the auditory and magnetic environments on EEG and ERP wave forms. 3. Validate that EEG recorded simultaneously with fMRI is of a high enough quality to detect task relevant single-trial signatures using supervised machine learning. R33 Aims: 1.Use single-trial EEG-derived regressors, constructed via supervised machine learning, to construct efMRI activation maps (stEEG/fMRI activation maps) for auditory oddball and Eriksen flanker tasks. 2.Use alpha power as a complementary regressor within stEEG/fMRI for capturing additional single-trial variance in the hemodynamic response. 3.Demonstrate that stEEG/tMRI activations maps yield new information for discriminating young and old adult populations, as compared to traditional efMRI and P3 and ERN ERP analysis. n/a",A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System,7274139,R33EB004730,"['Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Invasive', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'density', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R33,2007,432581,0.026245179904472903

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,0.04365714959127415
"Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illness is a great burden for the affected individual and economically costly for society. The annual cost of mental disorders has been estimated to be $150 billion, increasing every year, and this total does not include more than three million people receiving disability benefits due to mental disorders. It is imperative that we prioritize research efforts focused on understanding brain function in order to improve diagnostic strategies and discover more effective therapies. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool to visualize and measure typical and atypical cognitive processing. However, many important cognitive processing systems, such as those associated with memory, language, emotion and executive control, only produce small BOLD signals and thus measurements are noisy and have low statistical confidence. Hence, fMRI has not been readily adopted for clinical diagnosis of individual patients. I propose to develop greatly improved methods to suppress the noise sources in fMRI data in order to transform fMRI from a research tool about populations to a consistent and accurate diagnostic tool to study individual cognitive functions. Using the strategy that every noise suppression algorithm must perform well to reliably detect single trial fMRI BOLD signals, I developed visualization methods to ""see"" deeply into fMRI data to evaluate the quality of the data at every step of fMRI data processing. The preliminary studies indicate that there are clear opportunities to improve fMRI image analysis techniques. The proposed research will first develop and test methods to improve suppression of errors from motion and physiological fluctuations. Then it will translate this research by combining these techniques with pattern recognition to characterize individual cognitive activation patterns in typical and atypical populations. My quantitative science expertise is in image processing, algorithm design, and pattern recognition. The research directly supports my interdisciplinary career development with hands-on experience in experiment planning, fMRI scanner operation, neuroscience coursework, and new software methods for application to severely brain disordered populations. In particular, the subjects for this research will include important clinical psychiatric populations with disorders such as fragile X syndrome, Turner syndrome, autism, Williams syndrome, depression, and bipolar disorder, so that all newly developed methods can be immediately put into practice.           n/a",Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis,7075928,K25MH077309,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'body movement', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'cognition disorders', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'developmental disease /disorder', 'dyslexia', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'learning disorders', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental retardation', 'patient oriented research']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,162340,0.03263291008024916

"CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI,7051239,R01DA020949,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'cocaine', 'computer data analysis', 'drug addiction', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'genotype', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'reinforcer', 'substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2005,253116,0.05970781079307592
"A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated single-trial system for neuroimaging which combines high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to use this system to investigate variability in neural processing. The high-temporal resolution of EEG will enable the detection of signal variability in single-trial events, and this information will be used as the input function for analysis of simultaneously acquired event-related fMRI (efMRl). We hypothesize that using single-trial EEG derived regressors for efMRI (stEEG/fMRI) will yield high spatial and high temporal resolution information about the functional neuroanatomy involved in cognitive processing. This will enable construction of unique EEG derived tMRI activation maps which are not based on pre-defined labels or observed behavioral responses but rather on task and subject specific electrophysiological source variability. The broad impact of this work will be development of a new non-invasive imaging system (stEEG/fMRI) for the cognitive neurosciences as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The R21 effort focuses on development of a high density (64 channels) EEG/fMRI integrated system for single-trial analysis, and characterization of possible differences between the EEG recorded in an MR environment and that recorded in a standard environment. The R33 will then demonstrate the use of stEEG/fMRI in a pilot study of cognitive aging. R21Aims: 1. Develop an in-magnet 64 channel EEG system for single-trial analysis of event-related potentials recorded concurrently with fMRI. 2. Assess the quality of EEG collected inside the MR scanner compared to that collected in a shielded EEG room, using a series of predefined protocols for characterizing the effects of the auditory and magnetic environments on EEG and ERP wave forms. 3. Validate that EEG recorded simultaneously with fMRI is of a high enough quality to detect task relevant single-trial signatures using supervised machine learning. R33 Aims: 1.Use single-trial EEG-derived regressors, constructed via supervised machine learning, to construct efMRI activation maps (stEEG/fMRI activation maps) for auditory oddball and Eriksen flanker tasks. 2.Use alpha power as a complementary regressor within stEEG/fMRI for capturing additional single-trial variance in the hemodynamic response. 3.Demonstrate that stEEG/tMRI activations maps yield new information for discriminating young and old adult populations, as compared to traditional efMRI and P3 and ERN ERP analysis. n/a",A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System,6829951,R21EB004730,"['aging', 'auditory threshold', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'electroencephalography', 'evoked potentials', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'hemodynamics', 'human subject', 'learning', 'loudness', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'technology /technique development']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R21,2004,188133,0.026245179904472903
"Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a need for a non-invasive and continuous bedside monitor for brain oxygenation for adult human patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optically based technique that could meet such demand.  However, NIRS instruments have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming routine clinical monitors complementary to pulse oximetry. One major challenge is to develop an optical transducer probe and a corresponding algorithm to solve the problem of interference from extracerebral tissue (skin, scalp, and skull) in adult NIRS applications. Another major challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be able to absolutely quantify the optical signals to derive quantitative variables or indices that are of clinical significance. Our goal is to resolve these challenges to develop an NIRS monitor that will determine absolute brain hemoglobin oxygen saturation on adult patients.  The primary objectives of this SBIR proposal are: 1) Design and construct an NIRS monitor for use on adult human patients; 2) Determine the optimum adult NIRS probe configuration to minimize extracerebral interference 3) Evaluate and validate novel adult NIRS algorithms that further minimize extracerebral interference and determine absolute brain oxygen saturation.         n/a",Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor,6585412,R43NS045488,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain circulation', ' infrared spectrometry', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' optics', ' oxygen transport', ' patient monitoring device', ' respiratory oxygenation', ' swine']",NINDS,"CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,0.012927115745618955
