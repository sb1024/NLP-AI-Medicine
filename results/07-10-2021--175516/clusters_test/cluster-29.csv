"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.’s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group’s online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH’s focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",10305163,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,54000,533594881
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999,228951281
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437,304670088
"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,R03AG070486,"['21 year old', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data de-identification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'response']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R03,2021,157708,0
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663,0
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083,83544663
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,10132284,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,576876,304670088
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213,41751724
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065,34544143
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,10179293,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,663226,8894636
"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility",10101667,R44HL145826,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteriogram', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Iron', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stroke', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'base', 'cerebral microbleeds', 'cerebral vein', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NHLBI,"MAGNETIC RESONANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2021,667050,667050
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children ABSTRACT About 55% of children with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. Treatments are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. This study aims to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children. The first task of the study will focus on the implementation of a predictive model to identify symptomatic children with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s) or treatments initiated. The tool identifies patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Using this predictive algorithm, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). Children with (1) a new mental health diagnosis but no treatment initiated; (2) a new mental health medication ordered with no mental health diagnosis; and (3) symptoms identified by the predictive model with no new mental health diagnosis or treatment initiated will be recruited. The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, and reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed. The primary outcome is the percentage of youth initiating psychotherapy. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with at least 4 mental health visits. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use compared to the control arm. We will also assess initiation of psychotropic medications. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) implement ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-12 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering navigator support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6-month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children,10094734,R01MH124652,"['12 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appointment', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Social Workers', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adjudication', 'arm', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care providers', 'child mental health service', 'comparison intervention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'outreach', 'peer', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'random forest', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'structured data', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'trial design', 'urgent care', 'usual care arm', 'video visit', 'waiver']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,810761,111231681
"Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care Abstract Digital mental health (DMH) is the use of technology to improve population well-being through rapid disease detection, outcome measurement, and care1. Although several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that digital mental health tools are highly effective2-6, most consumers do not sustain their use of these tools7-9. The field currently lacks an understanding of DMH tool engagement, how engagement is associated with well-being, and what practices are effective at sustaining engagement. In this partnership between Mental Health America (MHA), Talkspace (TS) and the University of Washington (UW), we propose a naturalistic and experimental, theory-driven program10,11 of research, with the aim of understanding 1) how consumer engagement in self-help and clinician assisted DMH varies and what engagement patterns exist, 2) the association between patterns of engagement and important consumer outcomes, and 3) the effectiveness of personalized strategies for optimal engagement with DMH treatment. This study will prospectively follow a large, naturalistic sample of MHA and TS consumers, and will apply machine learning, user-centered design strategies, and micro-randomized and sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMART) trials to address these aims. As is usual practice for both platforms, consumers will complete online mental health screening and assessment, and we will be able to classify participants by disease status and symptom severity. The sample we will be working with will not be limited by diagnosis or co-morbidities. Participants will be 10 years old and older and enter the MHA and TS platforms prospectively over 4 years. In order to test the first aim, we will identify a minimum of 100,000 consumers who have accessed MHA and TS platforms in the past. Participant data will be analyzed statistically to reveal differences in engagement and dropout across groups based on demographics, symptoms and platform activity. For aim 2, we will use supervised machine learning techniques to identify subtypes based on consumer demographics, engagement patterns with DMH, reasons for disengagement, success of existing MHA and TS engagement strategies, and satisfaction with the DMH tools, that are predictive of future engagement patterns. Finally, based on the outcomes from aim 2, in aim 3 we will conduct focus groups applying user-centered design strategies to identify and co-build potentially effective engagement strategies for particular client subtypes. We will then conduct a series of micro-randomized and SMART trials to determine which theory-driven engagement strategies, co-designed with users, have the greatest fit with subtypes developed under aim 2. We will test the effectiveness of these strategies to 1) prevent disengagement from those who are more likely to have poor outcomes after disengagement, 2) improve movement from motivation to volition and, 3) enhance optimal dose of DMH engagement and consequently improve mental health outcomes. These data will be analyzed using longitudinal mixed effects models with effect coding to estimate the effectiveness of each strategy on client engagement behavior and mental health outcomes. Project Narrative: This proposal is a partnership between Mental Health America (MHA), a nonprofit mental health advocacy and resource organization, Talkspace (TS), a for-profit, online digital psychotherapy organization, and the University of Washington’s Schools of Medicine and Computer Science Engineering (UW). The purpose of this partnership is to create a digital mental health research platform leveraging MHA and TS’s marketing platforms and consumer base to describe the characteristics of optimal engagement with digital mental health treatment, and to identify effective, personalized methods to enhance motivation to engage in digital mental health treatment in order to improve mental health outcomes. These aims will be met by identifying and following at least 100,000 MHA and TS consumers over the next 4 years, apply machine learning approaches to characterizing client engagement subtypes, and apply micro-randomized trials to study the effectiveness of motivational enhancement strategies and response to digital mental health treatment.",Enhancing Engagement with Digital Mental Health Care,10114798,R01MH125179,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Advocacy', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Volition', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'coping', 'demographics', 'design', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'effectiveness testing', 'expectation', 'falls', 'health goals', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'self help', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'tool', 'trial design', 'user centered design', 'web page']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,872555,533302350
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence.

"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'rural area', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978,232986943
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic platform', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'implementation intervention', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,1484783,641965656
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10144919,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'home test', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2021,1807912,1992588
"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'European', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guide prevention', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep-focused interventions', 'sociodemographic factors', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,1968065,570146095
