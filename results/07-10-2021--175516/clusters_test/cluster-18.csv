"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,10336339,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,17141,77336088
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,10158011,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2021,31030,294146927
"Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) kills nearly 13,000 people annually in the United States1. MM is preceded by a less life- threating blood condition, which is similar to MM, yet non-lethal and asymptomatic2. in fact, most people don’t even know they have it. An outstanding question in MM research is why some patients diagnosed with the precursor condition go on to develop the full disease and why others do not. This question has been approached from a genetics standpoint, however there is no clear genetic link defining who goes on to develop MM from a precursor condition and who does not. Bone marrow creates a microenvironment to support developing blood cells. Multiple myeloma hijacks the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) to favor its own growth3. Without a genetic driver of cancer development, I hypothesize that the BMM is modified epigenetically to facilitate the selective growth of MM. Epigenetics encompasses that which influences the expression of genes without altering the genes themselves. Chromatin regulators (CRs) are proteins that mediate epigenetic changes through altering the ability of a cell to express a given gene. CRs carry out this process through modifying the histone proteins around which genes are wrapped (histones and DNA taken together comprise chromatin, hence: chromatin regulators). In addition to these very specific functions, CRs can also mediate interactions with transcription factors (TFs), the proteins that turn the expression levels of genes up or down. A specific CR LSD1, which is known to repress or turn off genes, has been the target of other blood cancer diseases and drugs designed to block LSD1 activity are quite effective in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)45. These drugs work by disrupting an interaction between LSD1 and another protein. When that interaction is disrupted, a master TF is able to turn on genes that cause AML cells to die5. Despite some similarities between AML and MM, treatment with LSD1-targeting drugs actually enhances the growth of MM6. Interestingly, a small subset of patients have been found to be predisposed to MM development through a heritable set of mutations in LSD1 – these mutations mimic mutations that confer drug resistance in AML5,6. While these mutations only make up a small fraction of MM cases, it points to LSD1 as a key component in the development of MM7. I thereby hypothesize that LSD1 plays a role in the progression of MM; this role is potentially specific to the BMM. The specific aims of this project can be summarized as follows:  1. Develop a computational tool using novel techniques from machine learning and mathematics to learn  about factors that drive the BMM to contribute to the progression of MM.  2. Collect BMM samples from patients across a spectrum of MM development to analyze single cell gene  expression and chromatin accessibility data to learn the ways in which the epigenome is altered as MM  progresses in the BMM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple myeloma is a lethal cancer preceded by well-defined pre-myeloma conditions that are asymptomatic and non-lethal, though the transition between these precursor states and overt multiple myeloma is poorly understood. The bone marrow microenvironment is thought to be altered in patients that progress from pre- myeloma to overt multiple myeloma and a better understanding of this tissue’s involvement in disease development may highlight opportunities for therapeutic intervention prior to the development of overt multiple myeloma. This project aims to analyze single cells from the bone marrow microenvironment across a spectrum of patient disease development, as well as construct a novel computational architecture, to learn about the drivers of this oncogenic transformation.",Determining the role of LSD1 in multiple myeloma through a multi-omics approach at single cell resolution,10154128,F31CA257625,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heritability', 'Histones', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma Cells', 'Plasma Enhancement', 'Play', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'bone cell', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'disorder prevention', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,87297083
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,10142244,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,51036,593605914
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000,1526571
"Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape Project Summary/Abstract The candidate, Wenpin Hou, PhD, is an applied mathematician and computational biologist serving as a postdoctoral fellow of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). Her long-term career goal is to improve clinical practice in therapy for diseases by developing computational and statistical methods to decipher spatial and temporal gene regulatory programs using multi-omics data and implementing these methods into developmental process and diseases. The research she proposes entitled Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape combines advanced spatial transcriptomics techniques with computational methods to infer spatial DNA methylation landscape, which enables the accurate evaluation of the epigenomic spatial variability and epigenomic targets in therapy for diseases. Dr. Hou completed her PhD in Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong where she focused on inferring and controlling gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Her ﬁrst postdoctoral research (2017-2019) with Drs. Aravinda Chakravarti and Suchi Saria at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) represented the ﬁrst shift in focus of GRNs from theoretical to computational genomics. Her second postdoctoral research (2019-present) with Drs. Hongkai Ji and Stephanie Hicks at JHSPH has further provided complementary training in reconstructing and predicting spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape using single-cell data. Dr. Hou's mentoring team consists of Hongkai Ji (primary mentor), PhD, an expert in developing computational and statistical tools for analyzing single-cell genomic data, including reconstructing and predicting temporal and spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape; Stephanie Hicks (co-mentor), PhD, an expert in developing statistical methods to address technical variability and spatial transcriptomics in single cells; and Andrew Feinberg (co-mentor), PhD, one of the founders of the ﬁeld of cancer epigenetics who directs the ﬁrst NIH funded Epigenome Center. This offers the opportunity to tackle signiﬁcant challenges in the intersection of statistics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics with advanced experimental techniques.

"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2021,150794,299503
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation. This will contribute to fundamental knowledge of disease initiation and identify potential targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.",Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation,10191781,K99HG011658,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'large datasets', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,170402,551214295
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500,14237512
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",10128377,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,225900,113554200
"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,10135120,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2021,289206,8388719
"Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project For many cancer types, the wide-spread adoption of cancer screening has increased the detection of pre-malignant lesions (PML). Despite such efforts, screening has had limited impact on overall survival. Clinical guidelines vary widely from watchful waiting (e.g., prostate) to radical surgery and adjuvant treatment (e.g., breast). In absence of reliable progression risk biomarkers and models, these interventions may have deleterious consequences at the two clinical extremes: delay in life-saving treatment or overtreatment. The study of pre-malignant lesions (PML) at molecular level present significant challenges: PML are small, generally archived in formalin. Moreover, the clinical significance of any identified marker can only be assessed after long follow- up, limiting the translational studies to retrospective collections. These hurdles have prevented the development and application of precision medicine approaches and unbiased biomarker to develop models of progression. The current proposal will extend the MCL Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP initiated in September 2017) with the goal to build multi-modal profiles of highly characterized pre-malignant lesions from the 4 target organs (Lung, Breast, Prostate and Pancreas). The four organs included represent a diverse spectrum of histology - pure histology or mixed with invasive lesions - and clinical settings - treatment or active surveillance. Similarly, the selected profiling methods are as comprehensiveas for invasive tumors atlas (whole transcriptome gene expression or DNA mutations) but also innovative, focusing on micro- environment and exploring spatial heterogeneity (multiplex IHC) and, for a few cases, cellular heterogeneity (single-nuclei sequencing). The propose extension will support the completion of the PCAPP and enable a uniform data analysis and sharing with the community. UCSD Statement of Work The following resources or laboratories will be involved in the work specified in this subcontract. The Oncogenomics Laboratory at Moores Cancer Center: Lead by Dr Harismendy, the Oncogenomics laboratory is located in the Moores Cancer center. Dr Harismendy has established his laboratory to be able to develop molecular assays, sequence in high throughput at the UCSD-IGM core facility and analyzed the results on a compute-cloud compliant with HIPAA regulation. The laboratory includes 1 senior research associate, 3 computational biology students and one programmer. It further contracts with systems and databases administrators located in the division of biomedical informatics or at the San Diego Super Computer Center. The IGM Genomics Center at UCSD: The UCSD IGM Genomics Center offers full services in high throughput sequencing as well as whole-genome genotyping and copy number variation analysis. The IGM Genomics Center offers assay design consultation, sequencing library preparation (DNA/RNA/smallRNA/targeted sequencing), single cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics), lllumina platform sequencing (MiSeq, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq 6000), and Illumina genotyping and methylation arrays. The UC Davis Center for Genomic Pathology Laboratory provides expert histology and pathology services on a recharge basis. We provide tissue processing/sectioning, routine and special tissue staining, immunohistochemistry, whole slide scanning, database hosting, help with quantitative image analysis and pathology consulting services. Proposed Work: For the budget period we will perform the following work a. PCAPP project management x Continue to organize PCAPP monthly calls: Until December 2020, these calls will be used to keep track on  progress. The goal will be to ensure that data is being generated and shared and to address any logistical  or technical question that may delay progress. In 2021, the focus of the calls will be slowly transitioning to  discuss standardized analysis and present preliminary analysis across teams and organs. x Continue to attend and collaborate with the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). In particular identify  immediate opportunities for collaboration and data sharing. x Complete the data sharing via JPL LabCAS and dbGaP. Data standardization, upload and registration is a  complex process and every member will need to be assisted to accomplish these goals. b. PCAPP data generation and analysis support x The UCSD IGM genomic center will be contracted to perfrom Exome library preparation and sequencing of  any supplemental DNA samples that need additional coverage or replication x The UCSD team will offer to assist PCAPP teams to analyze and QC their raw data. They will determine  whether the JPL cloud can be used to scale up this analysis and will provide forums and discussion board  for data generator and analyst to discuss the results and suggest novel iterations. x The UC Davis histology core facility will be contracted to perform high resolution scanning, cell counting  and analysis of the multiplex immuno-histochemistry data from the other PCAPP teams. c. Pan-PCAPP analysis, data enrichment and integration Unified data processing: The raw sequencing data (RNA and DNA) from all PCAPP teams will be re-processed at once to generate a uniform call of gene expression, mutations and copy number aberrations. Similarly, the multiplex IHC primary analysis results will be aggregated and processed at once to ensure that no team or organ specific technical differences occurs. The results of the Pan-PCAPP unified analysis will be made available in dbGaP through a new version of the data. Pan-expression analysis: Mitotic grade, immune-infiltration, presence of necrosis, or lesion morphology (papillary, cribriform, tubular, solid) may reveal commonalities across organs. Each component, or expression state, driving these differences will be annotated via gene set enrichment analysis to understand which biological signal and processes may be responsible Pan-mutational analysis: from a set of known driver genes in cancer we will build the oncomap of driver events (mutations or copy number gains and losses), annotate them for their known, likely or unknown pathogenic consequences and determine how their prevalence differs from the drivers identified in more advanced tumors. Pan-spatial immune analysis; across all PML and organs we will determine the relative number of each cell types in the stroma, defining hot, warm and cold immune states and determine their association with expression states or mutational status, after correcting for organ type. We will contract with Dr. Cambell (UCSF) to calculate the EcoScore for each PML, which will summarize a more context depend micro- environmental status, accounting for the clustering and distance between cells. We will determine whether the EcoScore is associated with specific histological features or epithelial expression states, independently of the overall immune-infiltration. Mutational burden and signature analysis: The mutational load (substitution and copy number) will be calculated for all PMLs and tested for association with expression state and histology features. Similarly for PML with sufficient number of mutations, we will determine the contribution of each of the COSMIC mutational signatures [4] to the mutational load and determine whether the presence of any signature is associated with expression state, histology features, or stromal-immune states. Stromal-Epithelial interactions: we will perform an unsupervised integration of the data to investigate stromal vs epithelial interaction. We will first select and abstract multiple epithelial features derived for RNA and DNA analysis above, such as proliferation, burden, presence of key mutational signature, organ-independent expression state (NMF cluster membership), common mutation drivers. We will then use random forest regression with 5 fold-cross validation to determine which features associate with specific stromal immune features derived from the mIHC experiments: hot / cold stroma, immuno-suppressive, proliferative T-cells, EcoScore, etc.",Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project,10269615,U2CCA233254,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial-Stromal Communication', 'Event', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene set enrichment analysis', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intervention', 'Invasive Lesion', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Papillary', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patient observation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'System', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Testing', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'computer center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'precision medicine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted sequencing', 'tissue processing', 'transcriptome', 'translational study', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U2C,2021,304550,607172798
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases. Project Narrative The proposed research intends to develop novel and high-impact statistical methods for integrative analysis of trans-omics data from ongoing precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns. Understanding the intronic codes that confer sensitivity to these naturally occurring genetic changes will provide insight into the mechanisms of spliceosome function as well as the biological pathways distorted by spliceosome dysfunction that may present new therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states,10183903,R01GM141544,"['3&apos', ' Splice Site', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Auxins', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Data', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Helicase', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spliced Genes', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'helicase', 'human disease', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patched protein', 'recombinase', 'recombinase-mediated cassette exchange', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,323400,179705973

"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767,2689914
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,10224662,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,480000,63682180
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss.

Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500,178569161
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082,329565273
"Investigating the Systems Genetics of the Patterns of Polysubstance Abuse and Addiction Abstract. Polysubstance Substance Use (PSU) is common among individuals meeting diagnosis for any substance use disorder (SUD) and is defined as the use of two or more addictive drugs. These drug combinations are associated with increased short- and long-term mental and physical health concerns. Due to the high degree of variability in PSU patterns, limited data are available regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying PSU vulnerability. The overall goal of this project is to use novel approaches based on genome-wide data to dissect the fundamental biology of polysubstance abuse and addiction. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will conduct heritability and high-resolution cross-phenotype polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses of probabilities of PSU classes in three moderately-large study populations characterized by a high degree of PSU, our Yale-Penn cohort, the SAGE (Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) cohort, and the ICGHD (International Consortium on the Genetics of Heroin Dependence) cohort. The PSU pattern will be identified applying latent class analysis (LCA) and a multinomial logistic regression procedure to substance use data available from the SSADDA (Semi-structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism; Yale-Penn Cohort), the SSAGA (Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism; SAGE cohort), and the SSAGA-OZ (SSAGA – Australia; ICGHD cohort). We expect that the R21-Phase analyses will identify heritable PSU patterns and gene sets associated with them, providing the background necessary to investigate PSU in other molecular paradigms. In the R33 phase of the project, we will test the R21-phase results with respect to two different settings: 1) longitudinal PSU data; and 2) PSU-induced epigenetic changes. Re-contacting a sub-sample of the Yale-Penn cohort, we will be able to assess the trajectory of PSU patterns and the consequences of PSU and to test whether the genetic factors associated with the initial PSU status predict the PSU trajectories and consequences. Similarly, we will also test whether heritable PSU correlates with epigenetic changes and whether these mediate health outcomes. The expected results of the R33 phase will provide multiple findings related to the biology of PSU that can improve clinical practice, deliver new therapeutic targets, and open new directions in molecular investigations of PSU. Public Health Relevance Statement. Polysubstance abuse and addiction consist of various combinations of substance use disorders, which by definition reflect the harmful use of two or more addictive substances.

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,10103847,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics. The reporter gene technology will be demonstrated for monitoring oncolytic virotherapy in glioblastoma tumor models, however, the technology is generalizable to any biological therapeutic.",Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging,10180072,R01EB031008,"['Algorithms', 'Amides', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protons', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detection method', 'detection sensitivity', 'gene therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'oncolytic virotherapy', 'pre-clinical', 'radio frequency', 'rapid technique', 'response', 'therapeutic gene', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'tumor', 'viral gene delivery']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,680476,551214295
"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Drug Screening', 'Endoderm', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth Factor', 'Guide RNA', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'control theory', 'design', 'engineering design', 'extracellular', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'self assembly', 'self organization', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell population', 'synthetic biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610,113554200
"Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects Project Summary We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects (CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear stress to gene expression.  This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.  Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more effectively. Project Narrative Abnormal blood flow has been shown to play a role in the formation of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, few tools exist to study how forces exerted by blood flow early in heart development result in altered molecular signaling. Our proposal centers on creating optical imaging to investigate mechanical stresses experienced by cells lining the beating, early-stage heart tube and how these cells and adjacent tissues respond in gene expression in each area of the heart during normal, diseased, and rescued conditions.",Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects,10211096,R01HL126747,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Betaine', 'Biological Process', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Heart', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Heart', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quail', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sequencing By Hybridizations', 'Shprintzen syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tube', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'indexing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,690676,197030888
"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1466398,560644462
"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development. Project Narrative The proposed study is to conduct a large scale genomic discovery of recurrent pregnancy loss using an integrated and innovative genomics approach and construct an intolerome to guide the evaluation of pregnancy loss in clinic and studies of the human early development.",Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss,10226657,R01HD105267,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fathers', 'Fetal Development', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Mothers', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Recurrence', 'Reproductive Health', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene discovery', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'grandparent', 'human pangenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1524247,550947887
"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders.

"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935,607172798
