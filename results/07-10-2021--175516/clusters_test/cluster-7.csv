"Data Science to Power Implementation with Social Determinants of Health - from Data to Action Specific aims Our overall goal is to build multidisciplinary networks around data and implementation science to drive science and translation, and advance improvements in the development, implementation and dissemination of medical evidence, with an examination of social determinants of health and disparities through the lens of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will focus on generating evidence on substance use, to enhance early detection, prevention efforts and accelerate initiation of and adherence to treatment. The focus will be on exploring uses of AI in big data and in identifying novel sources of data. These include but are not limited to data on the social determinants of health, including social capital, that would be incorporated into the health record and put to use in supporting clinical practice. Patient groups will be represented on the planning committee, on the speakers list and in the target audience. The intended audience includes patients, patient groups, clinical and dissemination and implementation researchers, medical and other health practitioners, social scientists, public health professionals and officials, patients and patient organizations, governmental and other health agencies, data scientists and other stakeholders who are interested in improving our approaches to turning observations into interventions that improve health. The proposed conference serves to plan and set the tone for such discussions, as it will address the topic of AI and health disparities, it will involve around students and junior investigators, and 50% racial minority and women participation as speakers. We will engage disparities populations in the translation and dissemination of research information, it will foster innovative collaborations and if given the opportunity, will create collaborations with the sponsoring NIH institutes as well as public-private partnerships.

"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,10218102,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38527,550947887
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083,127562714
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,52157977
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches,10292824,K23AR075070,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Serum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'crystallinity', 'experience', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'stem']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,54000,327644200
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects. This study will identify risk-factors for developing troublesome hoarding by integrating and analyzing clinical interviews and a web-based registry of adults that includes various medical and cognitive questionnaires and neurocognitive tests.",Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding,10253596,R01MH117114,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain Health Registry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive Hoarding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Impairment', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computing resources', 'disability', 'frailty', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'recruit', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,68363,188894159
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events Project Summary We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sister’s wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine the neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. Our experiment requires patients to listen to a narrative and later recall the flow of events. During the past year, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that quantifies the associations of words depending on the narrative context. I will use NLP model for annotation of the iEEG data to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding sequences of words. Our research program (mainly data collection), like all other human subject research, has been significantly affected by the COVID mitigation efforts. We were not able to collect the required iEEG data to fulfill the aims of the planned K99 phase during the past year. With the vaccination of researchers and medical staff and screening of patients before the hospitalization, our data collection program is reopening with considerations. The extension to the K99 will allow us to catch up with the data collection that is required for the planned training on advanced data analysis. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. The combination of iEEG, NLP modeling, and patients’ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions.

"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000,551214295
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865,230060143
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years.

"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375,570146095
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759,178569161
"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity.

"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD. This project is highly relevant to the NIA’s mission because it supports the conduct of genetic, imaging, and clinical aging research and fosters the development of a clinical research scientist in aging.",Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning,10106384,K01AG070376,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Social Behavior', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'genetic variant', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'pleiotropism', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2021,120420,524978793
"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis,10191887,K24HL157648,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Ammonia', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloidosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Volume', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diphosphates', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'EFRAC', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prealbumin', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Protein Precursors', 'Proteins', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient', 'Symptoms', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data registry', 'dieting', 'effective therapy', 'extracellular', 'fecal microbiota', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'hazard', 'heart imaging', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'medical schools', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'mid-career faculty', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized strategies', 'pre-doctoral', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'sonoporation', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'β-amyloid burden']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,121599,327644200
"Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons Abstract. The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS), a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases, health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost- effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5) presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics in high-risk populations. Project Narrative. Increasing tuberculosis case detection, especially in high-risk groups, is critical to meet the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 90% globally by 2035. A significant barrier to achieving this goal is that a large proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum and are therefore are not evaluated with commonly used and recommended diagnostics such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify the burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis in Brazilian prisoners, evaluate the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostics to improve case detection in this setting, and to identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons.",Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons,10105242,K01AI156022,"['Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Brazil', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhalation', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health Policy', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Masks', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Natural History', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'case finding', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2021,128574,164685352
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110,188894159
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913,37281765
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant obesity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614,232986943
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated.

"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Accelerometer', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'burnout', 'career development', 'data streams', 'design', 'diaries', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'meter', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research study', 'sensor', 'stressor', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338,533302350
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10382633,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,148243,550947887
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333,338121506
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,10087504,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'substance use treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2021,158923,36067938
"Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders ABSTRACT Childhood anxiety and depression are common, impairing, and have the potential to disrupt development well into adulthood. Pediatricians need mental health screening tools to meet the prevalence of these internalizing disorders early in childhood. We have developed a promising digital health approach for detecting movement and speech phenotypes of internalizing disorders in young children. My long-term goal is to create a novel technology for screening young children for internalizing disorders at scale. My short-term objective is to leverage my original approach and my proposed training curriculum to create a prototype mobile health (mHealth) application that provides a composite digital phenotype to detect childhood internalizing disorders. My specific aims are to (1) evaluate the validity of digital phenotypes measured by a novel mHealth system for identifying internalizing disorders in young children and (2) develop a composite digital phenotype for childhood internalizing disorders involving multiple constructs from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and identify moderating RDoC construct variables. If successful, these mHealth enabled digital phenotypes may be used to further NIMH health initiatives of enabling better tracking of changes in internalizing mental health status across childhood and supporting new and innovative research-practice partnerships with pediatrics to improve dissemination of evidence-based mental health screening. Similarly, this approach answers a need identified by the American Academic of Pediatrics for new tools that screen for behavioral and emotional problems. Seventy children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, oversampled for internalizing disorders, will be recruited for this study from pediatric and childhood mental health services at a university-based regional medical center that services the state of Vermont and up-state New York. They will be administered mood induction tasks design to press for RDoC Negative and Positive Valence constructs, while instrumented with a belt-worn smartphone enabled with the prototype mHealth application. A composite digital phenotype will be developed across constructs based on statistical classification models trained using machine learning on data captured during the tasks. To carry out this work as an independent investigator, I propose an intensive training curriculum to gain foundational skills in digital phenotyping. It includes training in (1) developmental epidemiology to better research early childhood psychopathology through a public health lens, and (2a) mobile app development to communicate effectively with app developers (2b) analysis of complex systems including machine learning approaches, (2c) ethical and societal issues regarding digital psychiatry. Completion of these training and research aims will provide me the skills and evidence to develop an easily-administered digital health technology for identifying young children with internalizing disorders in the short-term, and in the long- term, the ability to successfully contribute to the emerging field of digital health for the purpose of improving childhood mental health. This proposed project will advance a brief, feasible digital health approach to detect anxiety and depressive disorders in young children using wearable sensors. If successful, this approach has the potential to identify young children who are suffering with mental illness. The proposed training plan will allow this applicant to contribute significantly to the emerging field of digital psychiatry as an independent investigator as a long-term career.",Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders,10127012,K23MH123031,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'New York', 'Parents', 'Partnership Practice', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Valence', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Social Processes', 'Socialization', 'Speech', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'child depression', 'childhood anxiety', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disease classification', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research study', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sex', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K23,2021,161889,66370127
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,10189578,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,165725,560644462
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),10086087,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,166997,228951281
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,10137995,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model', 'statistical learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172704,641965656
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801,593605914
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,176541,327644200
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444,673201228
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209,66720547
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955,816607
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['18 year old', '2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 surveillance', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric epidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'State Hospitals', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'structured data', 'surveillance data', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188457,550947887
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548,2238991
"Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease, with nearly 1.8 billion new cases per year globally. ECC afflicts approximately 55% of low-income and minority US preschool children, resulting in harmful short- and long-term effects on health and quality of life. The current biomedical approach to control the ECC pandemic has had limited success. It primarily focuses on restorative procedures rather than population-wide preventive strategies. Clinical evidence shows that caries is reversible if detected and addressed in its early stages. However, many low-income US children often have poor access to pediatric dental services. In this underserved group, dental caries is often diagnosed at a late stage when extensive restorative treatment is needed. We believe that with more than 85% of lower-income Americans owning a smartphone, mHealth tools hold great promise to achieve patient-driven early detection and risk control of ECC. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies that use mHealth tools to achieve early detection and prevention of ECC at a broad population base. Our previous innovative work has led to a novel prototype of an artificial intelligence (AI) -powered smartphone app, AICaries, to be used by children's parents/caregivers. This AICaries app prototype offers a) AI-powered caries detection using photos of children's teeth taken by the parents' smartphones, b) interactive caries risk assessment, and c) personalized education on reducing children's ECC risk. The preliminary AI- powered caries detection module demonstrated a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for front teeth caries detection, using 6,895 annotated tooth images from 1,277 photos. We have recently built an archive of > 100,000 high-quality intra-oral photos that is ready to be used for finalizing the development of a reliable automatic detection algorithm. The immediate objectives of the study are - AIM 1: complete the development of AICaries smartphone app, maximize its caries detection performance, and achieve a caries detection sensitivity and specificity that are comparable to trained dental practitioners; AIM 2: employ a community-based participatory research strategy to conduct moderated testing and refinement of the app usability, and non-moderated field testing of the app feasibility/acceptability. Our multidisciplinary team is well-positioned for proposal success with needed expertise in computer science, AI imaging recognition, oral health care, mHealth, disparity research, patient education and community engagement. The AICaries app could facilitate early detection of ECC for many underserved US children, who often have poor access to pediatric dental services. Using AICaries, parents can use their regular smartphones to take photo of their children’s teeth and detect ECC aided by AICaries, so that they can actively seek treatment for their children at an early and reversible stage of ECC. Using AICaries, parents can also obtain essential knowledge on reducing their children's caries risk. Data from this R21 will support a R01 clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this innovative smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children. Narrative Although largely preventable, early childhood caries (ECC) remains the most common chronic childhood disease, disproportionately afflicts vulnerable parts of the population and has a substantial adverse impact on children, families, and healthcare systems. Our multidisciplinary team is proposing to use an Artificial Intelligence-powered mHealth tool coupled with a community engagement strategy to revolutionize the detection and monitoring of ECC at the patient level, which may pave the way for improving oral heath among low-income children.",Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children,10105768,R21DE030251,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Clinics', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Low income', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Parents', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preschool Child', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'community based participatory research', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'detection sensitivity', 'dieting', 'early childhood', 'education resources', 'empowered', 'field study', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lower income families', 'mHealth', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'restorative treatment', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2021,189800,179705973
"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Coca', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum Albumin', 'Social Identification', 'Social support', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment/Psychosocial Effects', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'built environment', 'career development', 'cohort', 'data standards', 'discrete data', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social relationships', 'standard measure', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2021,191778,415711940
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411,73424103
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,10164762,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dietary', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2021,192552,169622494
"Radiomics signatures and patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Sam Payabvash, a Neuroradiologist and Assistant Professor of Radiology at Yale University. Dr. Payabvash is a physician-scientist with specialized expertise at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and computer vision. His career goal is to find new treatment targets and to provide personalized care for patients with cerebrovascular disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most devastating cerebrovascular diseases with no effective treatment. To date, imaging markers of ICH risk- stratification and outcome prediction have been subjective and descriptive in nature, leaving a large gap for automated assessment of imaging feautres embedded in medical images. Preliminary results by Dr. Payabvash have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan to apply automated feature extraction pipelines and machine learning algorithms to harness the information in medical images for early risk-stratification and identification of potential treatment targets in ICH. In this proposal, Dr. Payabvash will use detailed clinical and imaging data of 3,991 patients from NIH-funded clinical trials, online archives, and institutional registries at Yale, Tufts, and University College of London. He will apply machine-learning algorithms to identify those imaging features of brain hemorrhage on baseline head CT scan that are related to symptom severity at presentation (aim 1). Then, he will use imaging features of hemorrhage to identify those patients who are at risk for early expansion of hematoma (aim 2a), or surrounding edema (aim 2b). These two “modifiable” indicators of poor outcome are considered potential treatment targets in ICH patients. Finally, he will combine admission clinical information and imaging features to build a risk-stratification tool for long-term outcome prediction (aim 3). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth (Chief of Neurocritical Care), Dr. Todd Constable (Director of MRI Research), and Dr. Ronald Coifman (Professor of Mathematics), this K23 award will allow Dr. Payabvash to (1) identify and address the most pressing issues in cerebrovascular disease with innovative neurogaming tools; (2) gain expertise in advanced statistical analysis of brain scans; and (3) expand his knowledge in machine learning and computer vision for assessment of medical images. Dr. Payabvash will receive didactic training in neuroimaging statistical analysis, machine learning, deep neural networks, and computer vision. The proposed research and career development plans draw on the wealth of resources available at Yale, including a Regional Coordinating Center for the NIH StrokeNet, the Center for Research Computing; High Performance Computing services, and cutting-edge image processing and analysis infrastructure. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Payabvash will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in advanced neuroimaging techniques and analysis aimed at improving the care of patients with cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severely debilitating cerebrovascular disease, which affects over 70,000 patients per year in the U.S., and is responsible for over half of stroke-related disability worldwide. So far, the diagnosis, surveillance, and prediction of outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage have mainly relied on visual and subjective assessment of head CT scans. Computerized assessment of medical images and machine learning algorithms can extract hidden features from CT scans and provide innovative tools for accurate outcome prediction and personalized treatment decisions in patients with hemorrhagic stroke.",Radiomics signatures and patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage,10301527,K23NS118056,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cellularity', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Edema', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoma', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Necrosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteomics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rogaine', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'college', 'computerized', 'cytotoxic', 'data archive', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'feature extraction', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'functional independence', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'modifiable risk', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'online repository', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment optimization']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,194939,550947887

"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk. Knowledge from this project could lead to the development of novel computational approaches that optimize the identification of predictive features in youths’ neurocognitive data, which may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts.",Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders,10213907,K23DA051561,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychologist', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'computational neuroscience', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'early onset substance use', 'emerging adulthood', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'meetings', 'model development', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,196560,641965656
"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052,511185245
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259,550947887
"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410,325573502
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,10164748,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data repository', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'substance use treatment', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,203040,673201228
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,10145569,R21AG067335,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Activation', 'Apoptosis', 'Atlases', 'Autophagocytosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Cytometry', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Formalin', 'Grant', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrectomy', 'Paraffin', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'antibody conjugate', 'antibody detection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical referral center', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical diagnostics', 'design', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'eosinophil', 'fluorescence imaging', 'human imaging', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'injured', 'insight', 'interstitial cell', 'ionization', 'ischemic injury', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney cell', 'kidney imaging', 'living kidney donor', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mast cell', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantum', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'senescence', 'time of flight mass spectrometry', 'tumor']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375,550947887
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions.

"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000,9132113
"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed. One approach to developing these interventions is to target proteins from the host that function to enhance viral infection, rather than targeting the virus directly. By contributing to a better understanding of how specific host proteins contribute to viral replication, the proposed research will accelerate the development of host-directed antiviral therapies.",Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion,10286563,R21AI163985,"['Amber', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'CRISPR library', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemic', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Fluorescence', 'Fruit', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Terminator Codon', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Transfer RNA', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'airway epithelium', 'base', 'combat', 'genome editing', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'protein function', 'respiratory virus', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236250,533594881
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878,673201228
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years.

"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Bladder', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Invaded', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannosides', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Uropathogenic E. coli', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'de novo mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleobase', 'pathogen', 'recurrent infection', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'time use', 'tool']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500,327644200
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213,533302350
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671,327644200
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890,558628098
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000,0
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138,377931988
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837,511185245
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,10080731,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural area', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'underserved area', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,351666,148463823
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587,533594881
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10236819,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,354795,28663340
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064,533302350
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042,73424103
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,10137881,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,390449,228951281
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243,32532200
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000,377931988
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613,641965656
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421,148186688

The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464,533302350
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,449250,415711940
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501,551214295
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995,499995
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,10205954,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat veteran', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,501996,340417756
"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330,570146095
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873,135941803
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790,164685352
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2021,575125,340417756
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,10171413,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,575613,323604360
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422,601447
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576,560644462
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779,136810522
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes. This study will provide new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. These findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals in the population, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.",Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes,10117729,R01ES031591,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Eicosanoids', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Live Birth', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Tyrosine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'economic cost', 'environmental agent', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'oxidation', 'phthalates', 'prevent', 'remediation', 'reproductive', 'software development', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical and machine learning', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,632023,641965656
"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults. Ultimately, accomplishment of this project will facilitate new strategies towards cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.",Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease,10099409,R01HL155717,"['Adult', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Race', 'Radiogenomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Texture', 'Torsion', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart function', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'polygenic risk score', 'preservation', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment risk', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,639525,135941803
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065,45341731
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893,415711940
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators. Our research will thereby provide new insights into disease, and well enable the more effective targeting of therapy to those who will most benefit at the appropriate time.",Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder,10238767,R01MH122569,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Far East', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'long short term memory', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'psychogenetics', 'public health priorities', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,667757,673201228
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385,254622553
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863,90419233
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258,254622553
"Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as a new threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2- infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. 1 Project Narrative As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.",Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness,10271147,R61HD105590,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement', 'Antigens', 'Aptamer Technology', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Burn injury', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'California', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fever', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industrialization', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'London', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Molecular', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'human coronavirus', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning method', 'pediatrician', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'testing services', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vaccine development']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R61,2021,698415,524978793
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983,1405065
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247,551214295
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,750000,981500
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026,292134808
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655,338121506
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996,377931988
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997,981500
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885,558628098
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19,10273964,R61HD105618,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'BLase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 assay', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'California', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'FDA Emergency Use Authorization', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'RADx', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'cell free DNA', 'clinical assay development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'genetic pedigree', 'nasal swab', 'novel strategies', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2021,863810,685608202
"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),10273778,R61HD105613,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensor', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cardiac', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colombia', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mind', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Native Americans', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'RADx', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'Youth', 'acute infection', 'arm', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biosignature', 'care outcomes', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fight against', 'gut-brain axis', 'instrument', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'pediatric patients', 'plasmonics', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2021,877921,488339
"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children,10272856,R61HD105594,"['2019-nCoV', 'Academy', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Virology', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical epidemiology', 'coronavirus disease', 'global health', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'seropositive', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'translational study', 'validation studies', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R61,2021,879259,178185562
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957,807432003
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463,254622553
"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730,560644462
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066,377931988
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'dieting', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872,415711940
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10080700,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,2648626,415711940
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,10126893,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,7216297,415711940
