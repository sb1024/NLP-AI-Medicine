"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,0.014254528309658126
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,0.04773148134907438
"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,9810433,P30AG064105,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Care Planning', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family Nursing', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'care systems', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'end of life', 'health economics', 'hospice environment', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'palliative', 'peer', 'person centered', 'pragmatic trial', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2019,768436,0.01832787640810963
"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment. Our results will help provide a tool for two-way assistance by enabling caregivers to fully program, adjust and customize the system in order to support the individual with dementia with improved situational awareness and timely feedback in the home setting.",CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare,9656662,R15AG061833,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Route', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toothbrushing', 'United States', 'aging in place', 'built environment', 'care recipients', 'career', 'caregiving', 'cognitive change', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'model design', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'smart home', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user centered design', 'way finding', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIA,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY STILLWATER,R15,2019,437757,0.033875961016579526
"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.",Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities,9842127,R41EB029774,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Commercial Sectors', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'care costs', 'commercialization', 'commercially viable technology', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'family support', 'functional disability', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized care', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,"ADAPTELLIGENCE, LLC",R41,2019,347739,0.033224018896079455

Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens).

We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data.

In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,-0.012044877009266054
"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NICHD’s mission that pertains to ensuring the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.",Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome,9730779,R15HD098660,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Calibration', 'Data', 'Down Syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinesiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'graduate student', 'hands-on learning', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'therapy development', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,423824,0.023327160104951925
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9693819,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,356218,0.017621470983005455
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,0.02034440914937034
"Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH Project Summary/Abstract Acute gastroenteritis (AGE)--infectious diarrhea—is a common condition that is costly in the US and high- mortality in developing nations. The cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapy (ORT), an evidence-based technique that has saved over 54 million lives in the 50 years since its introduction. The problem we aim to address is ORT’s underuse in developed countries—specifically in the home setting. If widely adopted, ORT could reduce 80% of AGE-related healthcare visits and costs among children, eliminating 1.3 million emergency department visits and $1.5 billion in hospital costs annually. The product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health application (app)--ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the home. ORCAH's innovation is in the use of the mobile device's native functions for analytics, database parameters, timers, notifications, and process state—for a novel aim: making ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countries. We hypothesize we will achieve an effectiveness (percentage of ORT tasks completed) of 80%. We will achieve our objective through 3 Aims: Aim 1. Use key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjects’ prioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a user- centered design interface, and thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAH. Aim 2. Perform cycles of iterative, user-centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app’s usability. Aim 3. Pilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methods. Based on the impact of ORT in developing settings, the gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countries, and the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problem, we expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability-optimized, effective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visits. Objectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH’s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud-based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient- generated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosing. The long-term goals are to further develop the machine-learning functionalities to update best practices for ORT, and to develop ORCAH for developing settings. The market for ORCAH—caregivers of children with AGE—represents a promising commercial potential, as about 57.9 million children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at least 24 hours duration. Data2Care’s commercialization strategy includes direct business-to-consumer marketing, as well as co-marketing with business partners including after-hours advice centers, rehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers. Project Narrative  Acute gastroenteritis—infectious diarrhea—is a high-mortality condition in developing nations, where a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has saved over 54 million lives and is considered the cornerstone of management; however, ORT is underused in developed nations including the United States, resulting in an estimated excess of 1.3 million emergency department visits by children and $1.5 billion in hospital costs for children annually. Through developing a mobile health application—ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household setting, we expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visits, and the associated costs. In the long term, through adding a cloud-based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient-generated data, we expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the science, delivery and efficacy of ORT.",Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH,9906781,R41HD101158,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Fostering', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Visit', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Notification', 'Oral', 'Oral Rehydration Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'User-Computer Interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"DATA2CARE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R41,2019,145682,0.031095136740156865
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,-0.008549471335354924
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.030645949348634873
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9821551,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,146551,-0.002097797752781601
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9755242,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'convolutional neural network', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,193160,0.05353719429790431
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,9810812,P30AG034532,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohols', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Factors', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Natural experiment', 'Onset of illness', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vaccination', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'care systems', 'career life balance', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'exercise intervention', 'experimental study', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'meetings', 'nutrition', 'outreach', 'population health', 'programs', 'provider networks', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'synergism']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2019,538532,0.01951044892564916
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9776419,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,474195,0.009076162201917221
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,9821055,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable device']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,136420,0.008715876776993208
"Developing an integrated virtual assistant (IVA): A tailored behavior tracking and reminder solution to assist persons with dementia and their caregivers Project Summary/Abstract Recent attempts to estimate early stage prevalence of early stage dementia in the United States suggest that as much as 19% of the population over the age of 65 may be living with early stage disease. In early stage, function loss, particularly in the memory domain, significantly impacts instrumental activities of living (IADL) such as responsibility for own medications and scheduling. Solutions are needed that can adapt to the person with dementia and their caregiver through disease progression, tailor the level of support offered based on the changing needs of the dyad, and facilitate more time spent safely aging in place. In this project, an integrated virtual assistant (IVA) will serve as the interface between persons with dementia (PWD), their caregivers, and a suite of smart home technologies to provide aging-in-place support. Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize IVA, a behavior tracking and reminder solution that will integrate smart home sensors, voice activation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an easy-to-use application that provides tailored assistance to PWD and their caregivers as a dyad. The broader impact of these technologies is more time spent safely aging in place, better informed caregivers, and a reduction in caregiver burden and strain.

"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,0.05194806434219693
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,0.04447160634757755
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0.01053983754947955
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,0.03576738893880401
"Changing Talk Online (CHATO): A Pragmatic Trial to Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia Care ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. NARRATIVE The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the critical need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R61/R33 pragmatic clinical trial will test interactive online communication training for nursing home staff to reduce ineffective elderspeak communication, with anticipated reductions in behavioral symptoms and inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in residents with dementia.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use.

"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­ moderated support. It has the potential to reach many families raising children with FASD in need and could  reduce significant barriers to care, resulting in a greater public health impact.

"Personalized Digital Behavior Change Interventions to Promote Oral Health Although preventable, dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and exacts a substantial personal and societal toll. It is closely linked to low oral health literacy and poor oral hygiene behaviors (OHBs). Using the high prevalence and burden of dental disease as a proxy, there is a large gap between knowledge about quality oral hygiene routines and what is practiced by individuals. The causes are many but ultimately distill down to a systemic failure to communicate oral hygiene instructions (OHIs) effectively or to engage and motivate patients in their own oral self-care.  To address the know-do gap, we begin by distilling desired brushing behaviors into a simple 2x2x4 OHI (brushing 2 times a day, for 2 minutes each time, all 4 dental quadrants). We will leverage tracking capabilities of our innovative eBrush platform to remotely monitor tooth-brushing activities in home settings. Using the 2x2x4 OHI and eBrush as foundational elements, we will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of personalized Digital Oral Health Interventions (DOHI) for promoting ideal OHBs in at-risk individuals. In the UG3 phase, we will build out the technologic infrastructure for collecting brushing data and delivering the DOHI. Then, we will engage target end-users in the co-design of an app for oral self-care and establish the usability and feasibility of the system. In the UH3 phase, we will build and validate computational models to infer the quality of OHBs from brushing data and personalize the DOHI. Using a cohort of 130, we will conduct a 10-week Micro-Randomized Trial to optimize the adaptive tailoring of engagement strategies. Finally, we will evaluate effectiveness of the computationally-driven, adaptive DOHI in promoting sustained engagement in the 2x2x4 OHB. We hypothesize that a dynamic and personalized DOHI will be more effective than traditional, static, clinician-delivered OHI in improving oral health and adherence to 2x2x4 OHBs. We will test our hypothesis through a 6-month, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Eligible adults from safety-net dental clinics will be equipped with an electronic toothbrush and the smartphone app for tracking brushing data. After a run-in period (4 weeks) to ensure technical proficiency and establish baseline OHBs, 260 at-risk subjects will receive a clinician-delivered 2x2x4 OHI and randomized to either: (a) an intervention arm where subjects receive ongoing, personalized DOHIs at opportune times; or (b) a control arm where subjects lack such feedback. Subjects will be followed for 20 weeks. Trained dental examiners will conduct assessments at each visit (baseline, randomization and after 20 weeks). Primary outcomes are changes in dental health from baseline (Modified Gingival Index and Plaque Index). Secondary outcome is the quality of adherence to the 2x2x4 OHI. We will explore subject-level features that predict the magnitude of response to the DOHI. Our team science approach presents a potentially paradigm shifting opportunity to leverage the growing ubiquity and reach of digital technologies to activate, educate, and engage patients in optimal oral health self-care in ways and at a scale previously unimaginable. 3c.

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9693725,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,515083,0.04579566704524803
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9780348,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2019,41136,0.033154033683050046
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,0.008718920460130687
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9735228,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,397016,0.03822369837563342
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9772539,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,189743,0.028969776889683423
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,9903672,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Activity Cycles', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Big Data', 'Body Temperature', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Dust', 'Encapsulated', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'design', 'diaries', 'health related quality of life', 'heart rate monitor', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'metastatic colorectal', 'multimodality', 'personalized intervention', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,316425,0.021894807026524035
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9789806,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,525499,0.011752974486307261
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",9977329,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'care costs', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,788082,0.012641558397514975
"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9560683,R44AG057267,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton', 'stroke patient']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,806285,0.0021371744415012994
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems.

"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10012469,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,1908341,0.00339342035758606
"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,9898123,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,225000,-0.00727892576289547
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,0.04773148134907438
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,0.03199285529867779
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9534766,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,357881,0.017621470983005455
"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy 1 Project Summary  2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur-  3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing  4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000  5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most  6 common impairments is equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed  7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP  8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention  9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access 14 to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the 15 quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families. Specific Aims are 16 Aim 1. Develop working prototype of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 17 MS1: Veristride will optimize sensor selection and placement; construct prototype data acquisition hardware, 18 firmware and software. Months 1-2. 19 Aim 2. Iteratively design HEART-Gait system: Milestones are: 20 MS2: Veristride and the Spaulding team will work closely to modify the prototype system to make it suitable for 21 monitoring toe-walking in children with CP. Months 2-5. 22 MS3: The Spaulding team will interview 10 clinicians (unaffiliated with the project) and 10 families (guardians 23 and children) to gather their feedback about the HEART-Gait system. Months 2-5. 24 Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 25 MS4: The Spaulding team will recruit 20 children (5-12 years) with CP and toe-walking pattern. Data will be 26 collected simultaneously from HEART-Gait and camera-based motion capture. Months 5-10. 27 MS5. The Spaulding team will derive a clinical index of the severity of toe-walking based on ankle biomechan- 28 ics data collected using the camera-based motion capture system. Months 6-11. 29 MS6. Veristride will collaborate with Spaulding team to develop machine-learning algorithms to estimate toe- 30 walking severity and characterize accuracy. Months 7-12. 31 Narrative Equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, is commonly observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP), and can be treated by a variety of treatments.

"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9586309,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,0.05353719429790431
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9589637,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,496662,0.009076162201917221
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,0.033154033683050046
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,30000,-0.04458384406042528
"Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias ABSTRACT  The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing worldwide, placing enormous burdens on healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Many new treatments are in development and the consensus is that most interventions will need to be initiated as early in the disease progression as possible. Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) has developed sensitive non-invasive EEG biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's and evaluating treatment outcomes. The biomarkers are in use in drug trials and are being validated longitudinally in a large population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Patients with MCI are particularly interesting as potential targets for early intervention as MCI is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia.  This proposal introduces a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The team combines ABM's 15-year success in implementing real-time neuro-sensing and dementia biomarkers with academic and commercial expertise in robot behavioral intervention design. Dr. Maja Mataric, USC Professor, Dr. Cory Kidd, CEO and founder, Catalia Health, and Dr. Schneider, USC Professor, will work with ABM to enable the Mabu robot to interact with participants in their homes and influence healthy habits. Catalia demonstrated that the Mabu software use of artificial intelligence to encourage social interaction improves medical adherence. This project will develop a SAR-mediated intervention for elderly users and MCI patients. Mabu will interact with participants in their homes to encourage and monitor the formation of healthy habits involving physical activity, specifically walking regularly. ABM's mobile EEG sensing systems will be used to assess dementia biomarkers pre- and post-robot intervention and during initial and final human-robot interactions, providing real-time metrics including engagement, workload, stress, and other measures of interactions between human and robot.  The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. The team envisions multi-stage user-robot interactions aimed at: increasing physical activity; enhancing cognitive skills; providing motivation; increasing well-being and improving quality of life. The Phase I focus is on increasing physical activity using the robot as a coach for a small cohort (10 healthy elderly; 10 MCI patients) selected from the ongoing ABM dementia biomarker study. Physical exercise is selected based on the specific evidence that increased activity can delay or slow cognitive decline. The Mabu robot will interact with participants twice daily in their homes for 6-weeks to encourage them to be more active. Project Narrative  This project addresses the worldwide demand for novel intervention approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias introducing a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. If successful, the SAR intervention in combination with Advanced Brain Monitoring's objective EEG sleep and daytime dementia biomarkers has the potential to assist patients in living healthier and more productive lives, maintaining independence for longer periods of time, and removing some burden from caregivers.",Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias,9679688,R43AG061994,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Gender', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Sleep', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'early detection biomarkers', 'human subject', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R43,2018,410550,-0.050795014437272204
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,0.05194806434219693
"Planning Changing Talk Online (CHATO): a Clinical Trial Testing the Effects of Online Communication Training for Nursing Home Staff on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Residents with Dementia Abstract  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk, which is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This 1-year R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant will prepare for a future clinical trial (in response to PA- 17-014, Addressing Unmet Needs in Persons with Dementia to Decrease Behavioral Symptoms and Improve Quality of Life) that will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD in 120 NHs. The R34 project will orient our multidisciplinary research team to address new aims; recruit and enroll NHs; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, study documents, and data forms; solidify plans for data management and sharing and fidelity assurance, and obtain IRB approvals. The feasibility of an elderspeak feedback app for staff that may improve CHATO effects will also be demonstrated in the NH to prepare for the clinical trial.  In the planned R01 clinical trial, 120 NHs will be randomized to the CHATO training group or to the control group. BPSD data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs for various approaches will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NINR's symptom management and caregiver support missions, NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The potential for reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD will be explored, addressing the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. Narrative The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years.

"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,0.03576738893880401
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9681835,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,576678,0.015359414871137657
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology

provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and

larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,0.04447160634757755
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,9391190,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Work Ethic', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient mobility', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,197848,0.0032721128591190383
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9461051,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,435074,0.04579566704524803
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9547265,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,395830,0.03822369837563342
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9502787,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobility enhancement', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,227166,0.028969776889683423
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9683680,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,569374,0.011752974486307261
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2018,825561,0.04163647038547068
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9412888,R01MH109496,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Inferior', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'burden of illness', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'cognitive computing', 'computer science', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high dimensionality', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research data dissemination', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'statistics', 'technology development']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,396101,0.004901116415875534
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,0.04151215648548444
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9314333,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,593935,0.04534247312451834
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,0.04773148134907438
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,0.034350544992142996
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change,9345760,R41AG056184,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Employment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Planning', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability']",NIA,"WELLTH, INC.",R41,2017,223743,0.011975138146546289
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9370133,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,352983,0.017621470983005455
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.

"mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an “app” from an “app store” that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.

"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,0.057511860083430004
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,30000,-0.04458384406042528
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,0.05194806434219693
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9303391,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,334829,-0.014196365119498755
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,0.04447160634757755
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,9115682,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Work Ethic', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,198331,0.0032721128591190383
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.017747028079736427
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9288252,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child health care', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,450361,0.04579566704524803
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9368213,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,397661,0.03822369837563342
"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9409715,R44AG057267,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2017,653843,0.0021371744415012994
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,9466569,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'body language', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,349861,0.00339342035758606
"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias Project Summary/Abstract This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",9409961,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,224986,0.012154579959331266
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,-0.021548428307975865
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,0.04151215648548444
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9109063,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,580914,0.04534247312451834
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,0.04773148134907438
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,0.034350544992142996
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating,9181203,R21DK108071,"['21 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Food', 'Future Generations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigator-Initiated Research', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Social Work', 'Son', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive task', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'emerging adulthood', 'evidence base', 'fruits and vegetables', 'good diet', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intrinsic motivation', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'public health intervention', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'young adult']",NIDDK,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,237377,0.01398927893688236
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,0.027933465516680932
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,0.057511860083430004
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,9039666,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,192605,0.0026793508513145467
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8974794,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2016,113592,-0.02282930152242311
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary activity', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,0.05194806434219693
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9103121,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,333930,-0.014196365119498755
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,0.017747028079736427
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9105328,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'mobile computing', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2016,456419,0.03894038057024338
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8892259,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,613425,0.04534247312451834
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,0.027933465516680932

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8891470,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor impairment', 'named group', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2015,223669,0.022057685859519217
"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.05637427785325589
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.            ",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,8873740,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'member', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,231129,0.0026793508513145467
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8776906,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2015,114082,-0.02282930152242311
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,-0.041627309260016496
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8935770,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,327802,-0.014196365119498755
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.             ",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,8967301,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Engineering', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'State Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,159057,0.0032721128591190383
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9077885,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2015,846167,0.03894038057024338
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,0.017747028079736427
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.            ",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,8949658,K24NR015812,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'patient oriented research', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2015,188616,0.05790572553373994
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,0.04151215648548444
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8705032,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,626698,0.04534247312451834
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,0.022057685859519217
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of  antidepressants for treating de- pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately re- duce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8634379,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2014,114449,-0.023529225920746407
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,-0.041627309260016496
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.                ",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8794633,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,334654,-0.014196365119498755
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,0.017747028079736427
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,0.03853365737167727
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8665495,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile application', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2014,330324,0.01107775852918053
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,0.032981377368538636
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,0.04151215648548444
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.                   ",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8496352,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,636036,0.04534247312451834
"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2.

Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,0.027933465516680932
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.            ",Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application,8492838,R21DK098556,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Proliferating', 'Psychologist', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'information processing', 'lifestyle intervention', 'medical schools', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web interface', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2013,263542,0.03718358067874942
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,0.01107775852918053
"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.                  The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Care coordination for older adults: Process, outcomes, cost    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research provides evidence that care coordination improves outcomes such as hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and reduces cost. One program using nurse care coordination as an intervention to improve care for community dwelling older adults' was Aging in Place (AIP) at the University of Missouri's Sinclair School of Nursing. AIP's service provider for the enhanced nurse care coordination intervention was Senior Care, a home health agency and Home and Community Based service provider. After the AIP study ended Senior Care continued to exist as a home health care (HHC) agency. Taking advantage of the unique data from the AIP study, and the HHC agency we propose to perform a secondary analysis to (1) identify care coordination interventions, intervention activities, and intervention doses used by AIP nurse care coordinators using enhanced nurse coordination, and HHC nurses providing traditional HHC , (2) describe any differences in interventions used by AIP nurse care coordinators, and HHC nurses, and finally (3) to identify whether outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost differ for older adults in the AIP and HHC groups. The original AIP analysis did not link specific nurse care coordination interventions with outcomes, identify the specific activities associated with interventions, explore intervention dose, or compare outcomes to traditional HHC. Data will compare two groups of older people who received services, those with enhanced nurse care coordination in the AIP group from the years 2000-2002 and those who received traditional HHC without enhanced nurse care coordination from the years 2003-2005. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods will be used to identify interventions and activities nurse care coordinators used when coordinating care for older adults. NLP transforms human-generated text into machine-readable (structured) information. We propose to use a unique iterative approach to NLP in which the available activities are extracted from existing electronic medical records from Senior Care, while new activities are identified by hand from records in which not enough information was found in the first pass. After each pass, a team of experts will check the extracted activities to assure that they are relevant to care coordination. Intervention profiles that are representative for AIP and HHC will be developed by determining what types of activities occur most frequently for each intervention category and target, and which ones are most representative of the category and target. Dose profiles of interventions will be developed, and finally, outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost will be compared between the AIP and HHC groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice. The Natural Language Processing method will add to our knowledge of how to successful use electronic medical record text data.              This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care. The marketplace for technology to assist the elderly will grow sharply from $2 billion today to more than $20 billion by 2020, according to new reports from Frost & Sullivan and Forester Research (Liz Boehm, Principal Analyst for Healthcare and Life Sciences) entitled ""Healthcare Unbound's Early Self-Pay Market"".           Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents. This development will be particularly important for observational and experimental studies wishing to investigate the contributions of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.                Relevance to Public Health The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment.

"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,0.035088553423118854
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.05649989681803974
"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR application entitled ""Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging"" is designed to create a low cost, continuous care decision support text messaging intervention to increase treatment adherence, decrease drop-out and prevent the recurrence of problem drug use during and following professionally facilitated addiction treatment. Based on the high drop-out rates during treatment and relapse rates following treatment, it has been proposed that addiction should be treated similarly to other chronic illnesses that require long-term intensive monitoring and care. Recent research on adaptive phone-based continuing care interventions supports the use of a chronic care addictions treatment model both for those attempting to change illicit substance abuse and society as a whole. There is an emerging literature on the use of text messaging and ecological momentary assessment through mobile phones for low cost automated disease management of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. Text messaging is ideally suited to addiction continuous care because the mobile phone is capable of providing low cost adaptive monitoring and feedback wherever and whenever relapse is most likely to occur. The proposed study is designed to develop the content, structure, programming and user interface of an automated interactive drug treatment continuous care text messaging intervention that can be modulated by the severity of symptoms during and following substance abuse treatment. The intervention will include web-based assessment, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), adaptive supportive messaging based on assessment results and counselor/social network alerts. The intervention is designed to both retain persons in treatment and help them sustain long-term change following treatment. We will obtain outside feedback and review of the preliminary intervention through focus groups with a heterogeneous group of clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment. Thought leaders with expertise in addiction, continuous care, text messaging and ecological momentary assessment will help develop the core content and features of the intervention. Specific content and programming benchmarks for success will determine Phase II feasibility. If successful this messaging program has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for the 2.2 million chronic illicit substance users who seek treatment each year without the financial burden and/or time commitment needed to implement traditional counselor based continuing care interventions. Additionally, the program can be used by clients of private addiction specialists and could be adapted to reach substance abusers in earlier stages of change as a stepped care intervention. Despite the emerging literature on the importance and effectiveness of continuing care  interventions for drug abuse, few treatment programs implement these strategies into care  due to lack of resources and financial incentive. We propose to create a low cost adaptive  continuing care text messaging support and monitoring program through the mobile phone  to help reduce drug abuse treatment drop-out and relapse among illicit drug users  attempting to change. If study aims are achieved, the proposed intervention could be easily  disseminated to providers, improve long-term psychosocial and health outcomes for  substance users and reduce overall healthcare costs related to substance abuse.",Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging.,7998538,R43DA029359,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Back', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, LLC",R43,2010,119348,-0.060304781046589255
"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7837153,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressed', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2009,493779,0.035088553423118854
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available.

"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7287365,R44AG024687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Copyright', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outsourcing', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'network models', 'patient home care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2007,378793,0.036570450611041444

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7051911,R44AG024687,"['aging', 'artificial intelligence', 'assistive device /technology', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'caregivers', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'confidentiality', 'frail elderly', 'functional ability', 'home health care', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'monitoring device', 'outpatient care', 'quality of life', 'safety equipment', 'self care', 'technology /technique development']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2006,361154,0.036570450611041444
"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,0.044391738124405035
"An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a recognized need for specific and reliable information regarding the dose/response relationships between physical activity and health for all segments of the population. New methods for assessing physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living populations are needed before a systematic evaluation and interpretation of these dose-response relationships between physical activity and specific health-related results can be undertaken. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, unobtrusive acceleration pattern acquisition and analysis system. This instrument will identify and quantify the physical activities that generate these patterns. At the end of this program, we will provide an intelligent system that is practical from both a cost and unobtrusive use prospective, thus making it an instrument of choice for epidemiologic physical activity studies of large free-living populations.           n/a",An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor,7107376,R43HD051014,"['actigraphy', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'body movement', 'body physical activity', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'cost effectiveness', 'exercise', 'human subject', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'oxygen consumption', 'patient monitoring device', 'personal log /diary', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemetry', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2006,122046,0.05290267195377498
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.

"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.      The proposed work will make significant contributions to several areas within the science of medical informatics, extending and integrating work in knowledge representation, bio-signal analysis, natural language processing, and consumer health informatics.

A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350). Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the intervention and control groups on number of batterer treatment sessions attended, partner reports of recidivism, re-arrests for domestic assault, and several secondary outcome measures. n/a",Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders,6485358,R44MH062858,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' domestic violence', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' male', ' motivation', ' psychological models', ' spouse abuse']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2002,383964,0.037630877757293
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6337676,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dietary lipid', ' health education', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' interactive multimedia', ' nutrient intake activity', ' patient oriented research', ' weight control', ' weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2002,123350,0.03211597801248102
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

"A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME We propose to develop and evaluate a wireless Personal Status Monitor (PSM) that can monitor the use of musculature in a continuous and unobstructive fashion while a subject performs normal and usual daily activities in the home. This innovation will provide the caregiver specific information describing their patient's physical and functional performance in the home, without relying on self-reports or having the patient leave the home environment. The PSM will consist of three components: I) wireless sensors to detect the electromyographic (BMG) signal, 2) a small body-worn transceiver, and 3) a base station, which processes the signals for feature extraction and transmission to the caregiver. The proposed Phase l program will focus on the development of methods to recognize specific functional tasks based solely on surface EMG signals. We propose to develop and evaluate pattern recognition algorithms using neural networks for processing EMG signals obtained from healthy subjects during the performance of specific functional tasks selected from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Proof of concept will be achieved by demonstrating that it is possible to accurately distinguish between these tasks using no more than 4 EMG sensors, even when extraneous motor activity is present. The commercial development of a PSM for the home will be continued during Phase II by: 1) designing and building the hardware, 2) developing the application software, and 3) expanding the development of intelligent algorithms to additional functional activities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development of a new method for monitoring functional activity in the home. The innovation will rely on technological achievements involving wireless sensors and telemedicine to surpass the capability of current methods to measure functional activity in the home. It will replace, or augment, the current reliance on self-report questionnaires, non-specific physical activity monitors, and frequent home care or clinic visits to establish a patient record of physical activity in the home.

"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,0.014254528309658126
"TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC. Cancer patients experience substantial functional impairments during and after treatments, often requiring rehabilitation and exercise interventions. However, a functional assessment of the specific deficits and impairments in the individual is needed to inform exercise therapy. The oncology workforce is challenged in its capacity to conduct such functional assessment, therefore limiting the ability of rehabilitation providers to identify and meet the needs of these individuals. This work seeks to develop a novel, low-cost PC/camera-based image/video-monitoring system that can a) continuously and unobtrusively monitor the physical health of a cancer patient in his/her natural environment, b) determine the existence and extent of functional deficits, and c) facilitate personalized rehabilitative interventions, providing a risk-stratified and personalized approach to cancer patient care. Based on patient’s daily activities or exercises, objective and quantitative clinically-relevant and laboratory-validated measures of physical performance (e.g., gait speed, balance, and fall risk) will be extracted by using state-of-the-art image-processing and machine-learning techniques, involving human-detection, pose-estimation, and deep-learning algorithms and fall-risk prediction models. By providing the patients and their clinicians with a real-time assessment of their physical performance, through a PCbased software and a Web portal, respectively, the system will facilitate proactive rehabilitation via clinician-approved, personalized health-care tips and exercise recommendations. n/a",TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC.,10267589,5N91020C00042,"['Aftercare', 'Automation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Oncology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'functional disability', 'image processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized health care', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'risk prediction model', 'software systems', 'web portal']",NCI,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",N43,2020,399961,-0.0024686879101316907
"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10058660,R01HD101842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Children', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Learning Disorders', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disabilities', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active control', 'base', 'boys', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'functional disability', 'girls', 'intervention effect', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,688574,0.005729061918693953
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10083570,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2020,549149,0.014691778103142778
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,10017845,P30AG064105,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Care Planning', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family Nursing', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'care systems', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'end of life', 'health economics', 'hospice environment', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'palliative', 'peer', 'person centered', 'pragmatic trial', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2020,758973,0.01832787640810963
"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback,10112643,R34MH125037,"['Academy', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Competence', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Cost Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family psychotherapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Videoconferences', 'Youth', 'base', 'care seeking', 'community based care', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'dashboard', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'service delivery', 'skills', 'social disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment planning', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R34,2020,359812,-0.010231899047909554
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,0.00035663560795050147
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies.

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9934286,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,354490,0.017621470983005455
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,0.024652321801391593
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The primary objective of the parent study is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. This supplement extends our design to monitor, assess, and intervene for individuals with ADRDs and their caregivers. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smartwatches, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to train algorithms for health assessment (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to extend brain health and objectively capture intervention both adherence and caregiver support (Aim 3). Clinician guidance is used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize health events (Aim 4). Given the unique challenges that will arise when we include individuals with ADRDs, we also introduce novel methods to track multiple residents in smart environments (Aim 5) and compare behaviors between individuals with ADRDs and the original sample of older adults with chronic health conditions (Aim 6). These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on a parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use clinician-guided smart home technology to recognize health events and the impact of a brain health intervention for adults with ADRDs. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias,10086759,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain behavior', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'rural area', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'smart watch', 'study population', 'technology validation', 'therapy design']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,366710,-0.01062192686017656
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10133883,K01AI141616,"['Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'disorder control', 'malaria transmission', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,48885,-0.002097797752781601
"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,0.04485580898654932
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,0.02034440914937034
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability.

"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,-0.015508660074339374
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,-0.008549471335354924
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9948579,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,146578,-0.002097797752781601
"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch PROJECT SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with the greatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality rates range from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains a particular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficient molecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitates a critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and track COVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development of novel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR, was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-low profile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto- mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensor communicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streaming as well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams are cloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows for the ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density. Specifically, we exploit the SN—the only location on the body where there is no dampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN- mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novel respiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop a new COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our cough algorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluate usability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partner LTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology, gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19 surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broad applicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after the pandemic subsides. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly resident in long-term care facilities.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9930511,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'web portal', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,531691,0.015359414871137657
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,0.001548954581869313
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9930430,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,384234,0.009076162201917221
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping",10045735,K76AG064390,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic stress', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Guided imagery', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Care', 'Sleep', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care giving burden', 'care recipients', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiving', 'clinical effect', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'exhaustion', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'loved ones', 'medical schools', 'mental imagery', 'mindfulness', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'negative mood', 'novel therapeutics', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K76,2020,213157,-0.04269283343644329
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,10017809,P30AG034532,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohols', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Factors', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Natural experiment', 'Onset of illness', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vaccination', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'care systems', 'career life balance', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'exercise intervention', 'experimental study', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'meetings', 'nutrition', 'outreach', 'population health', 'programs', 'provider networks', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'synergism']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2020,531220,0.01951044892564916
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.030645949348634873
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,9907705,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Bathing', 'Bite', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Eating', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Systems', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Panthera leo', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Sterile coverings', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'aging population', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'care recipients', 'coping', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'haptics', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'intergenerational', 'kinematics', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'preference', 'robot assistance', 'robotic system', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2020,65310,0.013495729359893429
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10029357,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,532871,0.027276624246347744
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate.

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9994897,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,41640,0.033154033683050046
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10003374,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,132314,0.008715876776993208
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['2019-nCoV', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Spouse Caregiver', 'Spouses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'comorbidity', 'contagion', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'foot', 'heart rate variability', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'risk prediction model', 'smart watch', 'social', 'theories']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,-0.06542205891158838
"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,9886675,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,669305,0.027181846172197356
"Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya Project summary This application is for the fourth, 5-year CoAG between CDC’s Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). Activities take place in western Kenya under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), CDC, and LSTM and benefit from LSTM’s existing infrastructure in Kenya. The research strategy follows the 5 objectives of the NOFO. The first objective involves the expansion in 2020/21 of the epidemiological (1.1) and entomological surveillance (1.2) platform to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets following the introduction of population-wide interventions in 2021/22. To maintain low transmission status, this requires a shift from the existing periodic, district-level surveillance to systems where surveillance itself becomes an intervention and can detect individual geo-located cases near real-time for rapid notification and foci investigation. We will support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) with their goal to digitise the data collected on their paper-based health registers using software that makes them scannable (1.1.5). This will include registers that capture case-burden data used in out-patient departments (1.1.6) and by community health workers as part of integrated community case management (ICCM) (1.1.7), and antenatal clinic registers that capture malaria infection prevalence during first antenatal clinic visits. This is a novel method to track the asymptomatic parasite reservoir in populations (1.1.8). Combined, this allows, for the first time, sustainable, daily, near real-time surveillance to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets. We will also conduct continuous malaria indicator household surveys (cMIS) to track malaria prevalence and intervention coverage (1.1.9) and entomological monitoring (1.2), both using adaptive sampling frameworks that can respond to challenges related to rapid changes in malaria transmission. As part of the second objective, we will implement population-wide interventions targeting malaria transmission, starting in 2021/22. The optimal combination of novel or improved interventions will be developed in close collaboration with CDC in 2020/21. This is likely to include enhanced case- management using digitally supported quality improvement approaches of ICCM, enhanced vector control with larval source management and insecticide-treated piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, and mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and ivermectin targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoir (2.1). The third objective involves assessing the safety effectiveness of currently deployed antimalarials for the prevention (3.2.1) and treatment (3.2 and 3.3) of malaria in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. We will liaise with CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta for the molecular monitoring of drug resistance. The fourth objective aims to maximise the public health impact by supporting the creation of a knowledge centre at the KEMRI’s CGHR for evidence synthesis and information exchange to enhance the translation of global malaria control policies (4). Objective 5 involves the strengthening of research capacity of the partners in Kenya by the provision of internships (5.1) and MSc, PhD and post-doctoral studentships and research leadership mentoring (5.1). PROJECT NARRATIVE This CoAg supports a collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the US CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health to achieve major reductions in the malaria burden in areas with intense year-round transmission in western Kenya by 2025. The partnership will support the expansion of the malaria surveillance infrastructure to track the progress towards malaria transmission targets, evaluate different combinations of area-wide interventions targeting the malaria vector and asymptomatic parasite reservoir to reduce malaria transmission and strengthen case management. These activities will provide pivotal critical scientific knowledge to inform and guide malaria program implementation and reduce malaria-associated morbidity and mortality through the identification and scale-up and continued evaluation of evidence-based intervention strategies.",Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya,10126073,U01GH002290,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2020,550000,-0.0023148729444429617
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9968231,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,387831,0.03822369837563342
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,0.05194806434219693
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,0.04447160634757755
"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9971443,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,515814,0.011752974486307261

"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",10002162,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'care costs', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motion sensor', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2020,710559,0.012641558397514975
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need.

"Administrative Supplement to Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual's independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer's disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual's quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2020,2217090,0.04163647038547068
"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,0.023989933224120838
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their

provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks

child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,-0.0005476229596770443
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an integrated health coaching system that uses a smartphone app to promote healthy behaviors. We will adapt it for metabolic syndrome and evaluate its effectiveness in a corporate health setting.",HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME,10084515,R44HL142328,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Android', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Central obesity', 'Chronic', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employee Health', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Fasting', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical activity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social support', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Water', 'Water consumption', 'Wellness Program', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'contingency management', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'social learning', 'standard care', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'usability', 'waist circumference', 'web-based assessment']",NHLBI,"HABIT DESIGN, INC.",R44,2020,726708,0.02468169746292222
