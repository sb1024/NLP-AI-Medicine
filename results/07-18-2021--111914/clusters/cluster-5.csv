"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9792299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'computational basis', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,665648,-0.023072132470773728
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.017530135678789655
"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual system structure', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open source', 'receptive field', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,794000,0.00583292260703625
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9694232,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318065,0.014042813745002793
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,9765324,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,254496,0.02465223704750516
"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update âmental modelsâ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A modelâs complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the âcomplexityâ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to âoverthinkingâ while learning, whereas less complex models to âoversimplifyâ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'career', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'information processing', 'insight', 'lens', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'norepinephrine system', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,-0.006048383677774454
"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9616849,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,35344,0.05639568100719898
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry â clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience â will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.012200350157681854
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PIâs research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PIâs pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PIâs research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.020624193943196267
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weakerâit can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations andâthrough thisâameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can âcollapseâ stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9741542,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,455418,0.05467762502624304
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery â we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is âshallowâ â meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized â understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system â and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics â to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,9814744,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2019,2774000,0.0011359806578139298
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of âCognitive Systemsâ and constructs âcognitive controlâ and âworking memoryâ and integrating units of analysis âbrain circuitâ and âbehaviorâ. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no âmedicalâ diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 â seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects â i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9688607,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,385524,0.009981011183058436
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9654779,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,694087,0.024594205386999406
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a childâs unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning â White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brainâs reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,9815781,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,535853,0.0041289699811082005
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,0.027198309921446197
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naÃ¯ve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested.

"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competitionâthat is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called âTwo Action Systems Plusâ (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain âembodiedâ cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9699553,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2019,394895,-0.001917678969255496
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9625164,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,383798,0.024522458194758647
"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9598343,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,18205,0.006089755785038881
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these âreal-timeâ pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical âroadblockâ with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9711359,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,405576,0.03510978829461253
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9669985,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,378758,0.028638641186378107
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,0.009591537059749002
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is âwild,â lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleevâs arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimerâs disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,9803682,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,575750,-0.02699126881816674
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function.

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.015366315530622003
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the modelâs fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimerâs, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9778913,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2019,3062362,0.002309534691532023
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive âneuro-psychometricâ characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9685247,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2019,714063,0.007878716619904861
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,9991267,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248994,-0.011927375881018833
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9797408,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,337875,-0.004549823672974267
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.",Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network,9754494,K99DA048748,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Drops', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visuospatial', 'Weight', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'deep neural network', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,159052,0.02904206963719614
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as âabstractâ contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9618883,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,720901,0.04165754632151136
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,0.020414148740962843
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9761233,F32MH119797,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study models', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2019,60854,0.02337812112603102
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,0.030360414078148476
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are âsign-trackersââthose that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others âgoal-trackersââthose that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (âincentive salienceâ), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9716629,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,233699,0.010329610793442748
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,120000,-0.023072132470773728
"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling âcravingâ states (operationally defined as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance â an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my labâs other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. Obesity afflicts ~35% of Americans, representing one of the greatest threats to the health of our nation, for both children and adults. With obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and other associated health problems skyrocketing, it is imperative that we focus on addressing the source of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.017530135678789655
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9461541,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,218064,0.014042813745002793
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9533702,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,278688,0.02188880214245058
"Toward Automated Spike Sorting via Ground Truth Neural Recordings PROJECTâ âSUMMARY Scaling extracellular electrophysiology to higher channel counts is hindered by the burden of data handling,storage, and especially preprocessing, e.g. spike sorting â[1]â. The burden of spike sorting can in principle be reduced through a combination of high-density multielectrode array (probe) technology and algorithm optimization to yield a spike sorting method that is both highly accurate and fully automated [2â4]â. With a known-good spike sorting method in hand, the algorithm can be baked into the data stream as early as possible to allow for automatic data sorting and a massive reduction in data rate to downstream storage and processing. However, it takes an investment of considerable resources to implement this sort of large-scale real-time processing, and great confidence to throw away raw data and keepâ âonlyâ âprocessedâ âdata. Accuracy and automation of spike sorting increases with the spatial density of recording sites â[5â7]â. Neural activity recorded from high-density probes can serve as a data corpus for testing the accuracy of spike sorting algorithms. However, to quantify spike sorting performance for comparison between algorithms, the ground truth spiking activity of neurons captured in the data corpus must be measured, such as by simultaneously recording via patch-clamp pipette or some other recording modality â[8â10]â.

"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional âcoreâ areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.009752555716043994
"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9345313,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.05639568100719898
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9534942,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,36594,0.015366315530622003
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of âCognitive Systemsâ and constructs âcognitive controlâ and âworking memoryâ and integrating units of analysis âbrain circuitâ and âbehaviorâ. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no âmedicalâ diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 â seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects â i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9471432,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,385524,0.009981011183058436
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,-0.016392054275317456
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry â clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience â will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.012200350157681854
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9526901,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,281216,0.027198309921446197
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9432559,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,729487,0.024594205386999406
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competitionâthat is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called âTwo Action Systems Plusâ (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain âembodiedâ cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9494731,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2018,381860,-0.001917678969255496
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIHâs Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9604145,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2018,36509,-0.0027813771570710097
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9415056,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,523129,0.024522458194758647
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9551101,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2018,1528951,0.005795660655998721

researchÂ aims,Â aÂ modifiedÂ dictatorÂ gameÂ (DG)Â willÂ beÂ utilizedÂ toÂ quantifyÂ bothÂ generosityÂ andÂ inequityÂ aversion.Â  TheÂ firstÂ aimÂ isÂ toÂ characterizeÂ excessiveÂ selfishnessÂ behaviorallyÂ throughÂ theÂ useÂ ofÂ economicÂ paradigmsÂ andÂ

"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.                ",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9380291,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58002,0.006089755785038881
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9449472,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,378758,0.028638641186378107
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9408628,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,327250,0.009591537059749002
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes.

"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are âsign-trackersââthose that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others âgoal-trackersââthose that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (âincentive salienceâ), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9527977,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,208699,0.010329610793442748
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weakerâit can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations andâthrough thisâameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can âcollapseâ stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9506818,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,455418,0.05467762502624304
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,0.026640067258898222
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the modelâs fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimerâs, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9568829,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2018,3072362,0.002309534691532023
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive âneuro-psychometricâ characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training).

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as âabstractâ contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9238947,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,777587,0.04165754632151136

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9292377,R01MH109177,"['Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'developmental psychology', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,373529,0.011189736045419153
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9245696,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,318064,0.014042813745002793
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9319333,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,278688,0.02188880214245058
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.017530135678789655
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9396350,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,35844,0.015366315530622003
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9247017,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2017,190000,0.021392767585549793
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of âCognitive Systemsâ and constructs âcognitive controlâ and âworking memoryâ and integrating units of analysis âbrain circuitâ and âbehaviorâ. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no âmedicalâ diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 â seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects â i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9318580,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382414,0.009981011183058436
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,-0.016392054275317456
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9301514,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2017,293470,0.027198309921446197
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9301669,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,709268,0.024594205386999406
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competitionâthat is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called âTwo Action Systems Plusâ (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain âembodiedâ cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9336000,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2017,418122,-0.001917678969255496
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIHâs Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9470585,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2017,36029,-0.0027813771570710097
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9356342,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2017,1528951,0.005795660655998721
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9238503,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,378758,0.028638641186378107
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9308020,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,492125,0.040069256005589325
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weakerâit can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations andâthrough thisâameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can âcollapseâ stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9354513,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,455418,0.05467762502624304
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,0.026640067258898222
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the modelâs fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimerâs, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9444124,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2017,3087282,0.002309534691532023
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.017530135678789655
"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9126614,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,384420,0.011189736045419153
"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling ""craving"" states (operationally defind as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance - an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab's other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. n/a",A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits,9284928,DP2DK102256,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Self Administration', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sucrose', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'addiction', 'combat', 'compulsion', 'craving', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sugar', 'technology development']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP2,2016,2560,0.003286385189382199
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,9107487,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,230351,0.016812826649005953
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9132359,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2016,278688,0.02188880214245058
"Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8996729,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,308040,0.017530135678789655
"Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology.  As a result, treatments for humans are often developed based on animal addiction models.  However, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  Some researchers suggest that the gap in translating pre-clinical to clinical models stems from untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive substrates on the modeled tasks.  Therefore, there is a need for research than can verify that animal and human decision-making systems are comparable, which in turn, could improve the generalizability of results across these research stages.  Effective translational paradigms are needed to test similarities (or differences) in cognitive processes across species.  The present proposal introduces a novel experiential foraging paradigm for humans, which was designed based on a go/no-go foraging paradigm for rats (Restaurant Row).  In the Restaurant Row paradigm, an animal has a fixed amount of time to traverse a circular track collecting food rewards after variable delay times from different ""restaurants."" This paradigm successfully captured individual differences in preference, as well as behavioral and neural signatures of emotional constructs (e.g.  regret, disappointment).  In the proposed human variant (called the Web-Surf task), humans make a series of go/no-go decisions as they travel between video galleries that present different types of video clips after variable delays.  The human variant was designed to mimic the rat variant while also considering natural human ethology.  Preliminary analyses in human subjects suggest the two paradigms capture similar behavioral mechanisms.  The first aim of the proposed project is to examine whether the Web- Surf task equivalently measures emotional constructs, such as regret.  The first aim also seeks to elucidate whether individual differences in behavioral task performance map onto variations in impulsive traits.  The second aim of the proposed project is to determine whether the Web-Surf task captures neural signatures of deliberation and emotional processing as seen in rats.  This will be accomplished using general linear modeling and machine learning approaches for processing functional neuroimaging data.  This task could be pivotal in reducing the gap between pre-clinical and clinical research, and more importantly, advancing the development of addiction treatments for humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology; however, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  This division may be, in part, due to untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive systems in the compared tasks.  The novel research outlined in this proposal will help improve the translation between human and nonhuman animal models, and in turn, improve treatment efficacy for these disorders.                ",Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making,9185215,F31DA040335,"['Accounting', 'Advanced Development', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ethology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Food', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regrets', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stem', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'willingness']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2016,36927,0.03359157687530109
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deï¬ne speciï¬c frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proï¬les of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deï¬ne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiï¬ed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ï¬ndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiï¬cant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiï¬cation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,0.029394824011107493
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,-0.016392054275317456
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9090040,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2016,293470,0.027198309921446197
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,0.00991689562588489
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of âCognitive Systemsâ and constructs âcognitive controlâ and âworking memoryâ and integrating units of analysis âbrain circuitâ and âbehaviorâ. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no âmedicalâ diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 â seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects â i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,0.009981011183058436
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.        ",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9112119,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2016,228000,0.021392767585549793
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.        ",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9128362,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,827432,0.024594205386999406
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competitionâthat is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called âTwo Action Systems Plusâ (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain âembodiedâ cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9213205,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2016,431274,-0.001917678969255496
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9205859,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2016,1443240,0.005795660655998721
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,9065984,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,400000,0.021443777260265678
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,0.009591537059749002
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,0.024286872623601588
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9131824,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,492125,0.040069256005589325
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weakerâit can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations andâthrough thisâameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can âcollapseâ stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9263587,R01MH069456,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'network models', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,521520,0.05467762502624304
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders.

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8860217,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,228077,0.016812826649005953
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9106892,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2015,285469,0.02188880214245058
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8929339,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2015,613100,0.02679661073667973
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.017530135678789655
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology.

The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,-0.016392054275317456
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9047911,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2015,311320,0.027198309921446197
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,0.00991689562588489
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8856663,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,400000,0.021443777260265678
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.          ",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9029452,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,507375,0.040069256005589325
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.",Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders,8847802,K01MH094689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ruthenium Ben', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Structure of middle temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory pathway', 'career', 'developmental disease', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'language processing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,168157,0.008007313541283576
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8892807,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serotonergic System', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2015,56042,0.01575357065501166
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8692440,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,227375,0.016812826649005953
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.            ",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,8802305,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,306165,0.02188880214245058
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8768889,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2014,596891,0.02679661073667973
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.        The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8686083,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,400000,0.021443777260265678
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8782905,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2014,53282,0.01575357065501166
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8532012,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,227049,0.016812826649005953
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.          This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.

This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.          This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8473286,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,384000,0.021443777260265678
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8537463,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,374225,0.053682717851067416
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding. The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes  sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders  of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8444787,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,246375,0.016812826649005953
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.              This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Agrammatism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Atrophic', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Functional Aphasias', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantic Dementias', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,-0.025798713117823408
"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.                  Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                   The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8312494,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,393921,0.053682717851067416
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.              PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE  The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy.

"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,8142855,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Location', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Working Women', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,311026,0.012141322754495872
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.              Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"Object Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.           Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,0.022907077791158154
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7883451,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,28699,0.02129428328190099
"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.              PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE  The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy.

"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7846781,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2010,317364,0.03732462304511311
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,7903878,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,329525,0.012141322754495872
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7581008,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2009,51103,0.022907077791158154
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7677589,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'depressed', 'depression', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28398,0.02129428328190099
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7692174,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2009,318428,0.03732462304511311
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments.

The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers.

"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes. In particular, modern sensory prostheses are now using computerized components that can interface with neural pathways to more comprehensively and effectively restore normal abilities in patients, and whose development faces significant obstacles establishing effective communication channels with the biological nervous system.          n/a",Causal Perceptual Processing,7545242,F32EY019228,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Class', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distance Perception', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plague', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Water', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'computer monitor', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'insight', 'object perception', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'sensory prosthesis', 'size', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2008,44846,0.010015419022665258
"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7408288,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'concept', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2008,48739,0.022907077791158154
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7480923,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,319340,0.03732462304511311
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,7615848,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Working Women', 'day', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,316386,0.012141322754495872

"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents.

"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7613805,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,320177,0.03732462304511311
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,7072822,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2006,197082,0.01616284583324933
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6899236,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2005,201825,0.01616284583324933
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies.

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6740109,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior disorders', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'decision making', 'hippocampus', 'laboratory rat', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuronal guidance', 'neurons', 'neuropsychology', 'online computer', 'performance', 'short term memory', 'space perception', 'stimulus /response', 'temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,252000,0.011984137924353969

"Embedded Tools for Processing Neural Ensembles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-electrode recording from ensembles of neurons in awake, behaving animals is a central technique for understanding the neural basis of behavior and nervous systems disorders, and a prerequisite to the creation of neural-controlled prostheses.

"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6639188,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2003,123541,0.04016095249142417

The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6671314,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' learning', ' light intensity', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory signal detection', ' visual feedback', ' visual perception', ' visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2003,229705,0.01616284583324933
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6539118,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2002,123541,0.04016095249142417

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6327522,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2001,249250,0.004054374541635734

"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6090371,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2000,123541,0.04016095249142417
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus.

"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior â factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldnât it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces â devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from todayâs simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10012013,DP1NS122038,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Feeling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Office Visits', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'blind', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learned behavior', 'learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2020,1134000,0.008816566200417054
"A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States Project Summary Advances in neural recording technology now provide access to neural activity at high temporal resolutions, from many brain areas, and during complex and naturalistic behavior. Interpreting these types of high-dimensional and unconstrained neural recordings is still a major challenge in neuroscience. The aim of this project is to develop innovative methods for distilling high-dimensional neural activity patterns into simpler low-dimensional formats that can be effectively compared across time, conditions, or even across species. Our team is uniquely positioned to not only develop these novel methods, but also apply them to characterize changes in neural systems across a wide range of clinically-relevant perturbations, including addiction, sensory manipulation, and disease. In this project, theory, methods, and models will be developed for: 1) learning low-dimensional latent space models that align many neural datasets onto a common reference frame for comparison, 2) comparing datasets and testing the impact of a variety of perturbations (e.g. monocular deprivation, addiction and withdrawal) on the shape or geometry of neural activity from its baseline state, and 3) investigating the role of specific cell types and microcircuits on shaping population activity over time, during sleep, and in response to certain classes of perturbations. This project will provide new tools and frameworks for comparing neural datasets, leading to robust measures of disease, signatures of addiction, and other network-level reflections of environment and behavior. Significance: As neural datasets continue to grow in size, new methods for analysis are becoming of utmost importance in driving scientific understanding of the brain. The methods developed in this proposal will identify new ways to learn network-level signatures that allow us to link and compare different neural activity patterns. A robust ability to compare activity across time and animals will have wide reaching impacts, and provide new tools to advance network-level understanding of disease. Innovation: This project will leverage state-of-the-art approaches in high-dimensional statistics and geometry, which are simultaneously advancing in the context of deep learning (DL) architectures, and to tackle challenges in neural coding. This project represents a truly innovative combination of tools in machine learning and computational neuroscience which will likely transfer knowledge in both directions: from machine learning to neuroscience and back. The unique application of advanced mathematical tools in geometry and optimization to population-level analysis of perturbations will be transformative, not only for neuroscience but also in the study of DL architectures. Project Narrative Interpreting patterns of activity across large networks of neurons is an incredibly challenging problem that remains a key objective of the BRAIN initiative. This project will develop transformative methods for distilling neural activity patterns into compact, informative representations that facilitate comparison across datasets from different brain areas and multiple time-scales, and at different states of neurological disease.",A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States,10007243,R01EB029852,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'deprivation', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'monocular deprivation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,1000000,-0.004544292898052484
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of âopen sourceâ models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,9874435,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2020,235500,0.013368223641594384
"Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Over 5 million people in the USA â nearly 1 person in 50 â live with a form of paralysis due to causes including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and ALS. People who have lost the ability to move also lose a profound sense of control, freedom, and independence in their lives. But paralysis does not take away one's intent or desire to move; the brain still encodes these thoughts through neural signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore the ability to communicate with the world by translating these neural signals into actions. BMIs decode neural signals into the movements of a computer cursor on a screen or a robotic arm, allowing the user to interact with the world autonomously. While BMIs have existed for over two decades, they have remained in pilot clinical trials dating back to 2004 and have not achieved widespread use. The key reason for this is that BMI performance has not achieved levels of performance that overcome their costs and risks. This is true for both invasive BMIs requiring neurosurgery, as well as for non-invasive BMIs, which can be used without surgical procedures but achieve low performance. This proposal aims to dramatically increase the quality of life for millions with paralysis by making widely accessi- ble BMIs available within the next ï¬ve years. To achieve this groundbreaking goal, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way BMIs fundamentally operate. Revolutionary next generation BMIs making signiï¬cant impact must be designed to: (1) achieve categorically unprecedented performance not possible with current BMI systems (e.g., over an order of magnitude improvement) and (2) minimize cost to patients, ideally being non-invasive. En- tirely novel BMI architectures are needed to fundamentally transcend a performance vs cost trade-off, achieving excellent performance at lower risks and costs. To meet this need, I propose to develop a next-generation BMI where the user and an artiï¬cial intelligence (AI) agent synergistically cooperate. We term this an âAI-BMI.â The AI agent predicts the user's intended motor actions and synergistically helps to complete them. Critically, the AI agent aids the precise and detailed execution of the user's intended movements, augmenting performance. By doing so, this architecture fundamentally changes the design objectives of BMIs from neural decoding of precise movements (difï¬cult) to behavioral and neural inference of the user's intent (easier). Non-invasive AI-BMIs, if successful, would be transformative, enabling next generation BMI technology that allows people with paralysis to once again move, but mitigates medical risks associated with neurosurgery and lowers system costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, brain- mahince interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain to control prosthetic devices. The proposed work aims to create and optimize a new class of transformative BMIs that incorporate an external artiï¬cial intelligence agent who infers the user's intent and helps to carry out prosthesis actions. If successful, these new BMIs would signiï¬cantly increase BMI performance while lowering risks and costs, enabling widespread use.",Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence,10003004,DP2NS122037,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Medical', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Transcend', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'cost', 'design', 'intelligent agent', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2020,2340000,0.0018371572904971613

The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weakerâit can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations andâthrough thisâameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9910403,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,306185,0.014042813745002793
"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brainâs sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (âthoughtsâ) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animalâs  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics â all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function. n/a",CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging,10146521,R01NS120407,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Fireflies', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Instruction', 'Juice', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Utah', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,423814,0.01396837585872841
"Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans PROJECT SUMMARY A diverse range of behaviors including language, event segmentation, and learning to play an instrument involve parsing complex temporal sequences. Item co-occurrence in a sequence can exist between pairs of items shown consecutively, as well as triplets, quadruplets and other higher order sets. For example, when learning a language both humans and natural language processing algorithms make use of first order statistics about which words tend to follow others, and higher-order statistics about the grammar of sentences and paragraphs. The statistics of this co-occurrence between sets of different sizes can influence how well people learn the sequence. We can demonstrate this learning by presenting stimuli in a sequence determined by a walk on a highly clustered graph where stimuli within a large cluster tend to co-occur more frequently than stimuli in different clusters. When subjects are shown motor cues generated from a walk on such a graph, they exhibit shorter reaction times and more similar BOLD activity for successive cues drawn from the same cluster than when they are drawn from different clusters. Generalizable theories of hippocampal function suggest that its role in learning and predicting abstract relationships could subserve this behavior. In line with this theory, neuroimaging data implicates the hippocampus and downstream cortical regions in this behavior. However, direct electrophysiological measures of neural activity during the performance of this task have not been examined, leaving the description of the neural underpinnings of the behavior incomplete. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that activity in the hippocampus reflects behavioral change across clusters, and is sensitive to higher-order associations between stimuli. Our investigation is an important next step in testing theories of how the hippocampus aids relational learning, and it will add to knowledge of how information in the world is represented in the brain and how it aids or hinders learning. PROJECT NARATIVE Identifying complex relationships between items in a sequence is a crucial component of learning in humans, and is thought to rely on activity in the hippocampus. However, the neural substrates that allow humans to learn higher-order statistics among stimuli in a sequence have not been fully explored, greatly limiting our understanding of sequential information encoding in the brain. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that hippocampal activity reflects these complex relationships between items, and tracks behavioral changes that demonstrate learning.",Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans,9991400,F31MH120925,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Distant', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quadruplet Multiple Birth', 'Reaction Time', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Walking', 'discounting', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories', 'way finding']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.0008847020918280791
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naÃ¯ve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,9995591,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,327626,0.0012101703412522589
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience â to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional âcoreâ areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,0.009784499832103095
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry â clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience â will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.012200350157681854
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PIâs research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PIâs pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PIâs research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,0.020624193943196267
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of âCognitive Systemsâ and constructs âcognitive controlâ and âworking memoryâ and integrating units of analysis âbrain circuitâ and âbehaviorâ. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no âmedicalâ diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 â seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects â i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9949794,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,385524,0.009981011183058436
"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system â based on dopamine â that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these âprediction errorâ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level âtask statesâ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to âdecodeâ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,9947251,R01DA050647,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Update', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'dopamine system', 'drug of abuse', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,283500,0.011511084709850789
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable âthe reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (âNeuropixelsâ probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,0.0037268133963130876
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,9813516,F30MH118888,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Negative Valence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'chronic depression', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depression model', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'goal oriented behavior', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'millisecond', 'motivated behavior', 'mouse model', 'neural model', 'optogenetics', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37351,0.011887704219343953
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is âwild,â lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleevâs arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimerâs disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,10006884,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,575750,-0.02699126881816674
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery â we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is âshallowâ â meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized â understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system â and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics â to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10001592,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2020,2773998,0.0011359806578139298
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,10016303,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'developmental prosopagnosia', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,265973,0.02465223704750516
"Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation Project Abstract/Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a cognitive neuroscientist with prior training in electroencephalography (EEG), to conduct research on contextual memory representation using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. EEG is useful for examining the timing properties of neural activity, but cannot localize activity to specific regions of the brain. In this proposal, I will receive training on a high-spatial resolution neuroimaging technique (fMRI), which will allow me to develop theories of neural function that are constrained by both space and time. I will also build on my prior degree in applied statistics and receive additional training in computational neuroscience, which will enable me to develop computational theories at the macro-circuit level. I will be supervised by Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill, an expert fMRI experimentalist and theorist of lateral prefrontal cortex function, who has extensive experience researching the context-dependent nature of semantic memory. I will be co-supervised by Dr. Anna Schapiro, an expert on statistical learning and computational modeling of the brain. I propose to examine how prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents statistical dependencies among sequentially presented visual and auditory input. I will examine how the temporal extent and level of abstraction of sequential representations changes across ventral PFC. This will connect findings from several literatures, ranging from decision-making to emotion processing and language comprehension, within a single unifying framework. In addition, I will explore whether âdeepâ or âshallowâ recurrent neural networks better capture the sensitivity profile of ventral PFC, informing the question of whether the brain conducts âdeepâ learning. In Aim 1, I will conduct behavioral piloting and collect data for two neuroimaging experiments on hierarchical sequential processing. I will have participants learn the statistical properties of hierarchically organized sequences of abstract visual (Aim 1a&b) and auditory (Aim 1b) images. I then test for neural sensitivity to statistical learning at each hierarchical level using pattern similarity analysis, comparing the neural response to the sequences before and after learning. In Aim 2, I will conduct computational modeling of the neuroimaging data in Aim 1, with held out data to ensure robustness and reproducibility. I compare the neuroimaging data to internal model representations derived from single-layer (âshallowâ) and multi-layer (âdeepâ) recurrent neural networks trained on the same sequences as the humans in Aim 1. By modeling the neural representation of context itself, the current proposal will help fill a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain predicts upcoming sensory input, enabling rapid processing of the world around us. It will also inform our understanding of several psychiatric disorders that involve prefrontal cortex disfunction and disturbances of contextual processing, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Project Narrative As we navigate the world we are bombarded by a flood of sensations that our brain must rapidly make sense of, and understanding the context we are in as it relates to the likelihood of upcoming experiences is important for enhancing the speed and accuracy of this process. This proposal examines how sensory context is represented in the brain, by having people learn statistical regularities in artificial sequences of images and syllables and modeling neural activity in prefrontal cortex as they are exposed to different sensory âcontextsâ using fMRI. Through computational modeling of prefrontal cortex, we can enhance our understanding of the function of a brain region implicated in many neuropsychological disorders where the perception of context is distorted or disrupted, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation,9990118,F32MH123002,"['Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'language comprehension', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sequence learning', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2020,64926,0.02238276628309042
"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as âcredit assignmentâ. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environmentâs causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call âmodel-based credit assignment)â, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call âmodel-freeâ credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that âfire-together/wire-togetherâ plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with ârepresentationalâ analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract âlatentâ causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10064687,R56MH119116,"['Address', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clams', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Restaurants', 'Role', 'Scallop', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Service delivery model', 'Shellfish', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'shellfish hypersensitivity', 'sound', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,385349,0.017835336805210676
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9963415,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.015366315530622003
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a childâs unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning â White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brainâs reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10013256,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,531494,0.0041289699811082005
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9889999,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,680053,0.024594205386999406
"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability and may be targets for future novel preventive efforts. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen).",Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability,10051164,R01MH121385,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Accounting', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neural Inhibition', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Sex Ratio', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Temperament', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'contextual factors', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'support network']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,759490,0.020615935527721514
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10005106,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248038,-0.011927375881018833
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIHâs Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,10214202,K00NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'post stroke', 'posters', 'powered exoskeleton', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K00,2020,72598,-0.0027813771570710097
"Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex Project Summary People are remarkably adept at making sense of the world through sound: understanding speech in a noisy restaurant, picking out the voice of a family member, or recognizing a familiar melody. Although we take these abilities for granted, they reflect impressive computational feats of biological engineering that are remarkably difficult to replicate in machine systems. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop computational and experimental methods to reverse-engineer how the brain codes natural sounds like speech and to exploit these advances to understand and aid in the treatment of hearing impairment. One of the central challenges of coding natural sounds is that they are structured at many different timescales from milliseconds to seconds and even minutes. How does the brain integrate across these diverse timescales to derive meaning from sound? Answering this question has been challenging because there are no general-purpose methods for measuring neural timescales in the brain. As a consequence, we know relatively little about how neural timescales are organized in auditory cortex and how this organization enables the coding of natural sounds. To overcome these limitations, we develop a simple experimental paradigm (the âtemporal context invarianceâ or TCI paradigm) for estimating the temporal integration period of any sensory response: the time window during which stimuli alter the response. We apply the TCI method to human electrocorticography (ECoG) and animal physiology recordings to reveal the organization of neural timescales at both the region and single-cell level (Aim I). Pilot data from our analyses reveal that timescales are organized hierarchically, with higher-order regions showing substantially longer integration periods. To explore the functional significance of this timescale hierarchy, we couple TCI with computational techniques well-suited for characterizing natural sounds (Aim II). We test whether increased integration periods enable a more noise-robust representation of speech (Aim IIA), whether regions with longer integration periods code higher-order properties of natural sounds (Aim IIB&IIC), whether there are dedicated integration periods for important sounds categories like speech or music (Aim IID), and whether cortical integration periods can be explained by the duration of the features they respond to (Aim IIE). In the process of conducting this research, I will be trained in two critical areas: (1) ECoG, which is the only method with the spatial and temporal precision to understand how neural timescales are organized in the human brain (2) deep neural networks (DNN) which are the only models able to perform challenging perceptual tasks at human levels and predict neural responses in higher-order cortical regions. After completing this training, I will have a unique set of experimental (fMRI, ECoG, psychophysics) and computational skills (data-driven statistical modeling and hypothesis-driven DNN modeling), which will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Natural sounds like speech contain information at many different timescales (e.g. phonemes, syllables, words), but how the human brain extracts this information remains unclear. Understanding this process is critical to understanding how hearing impairment degrades speech perception. The proposed research will reveal the organization of neural timescales in the brain, and how this organization facilitates the coding of natural sounds like speech, which is a critical first step in understanding how this code is impaired by hearing loss.",Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex,9977571,K99DC018051,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Engineering', 'Family member', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Restaurants', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Voice', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'millisecond', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2020,125442,-0.0872885512259852
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background ânoiseâ distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments â and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world âbackground noiseâ was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments â and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10104430,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,64926,0.008411341368972591
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9944496,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Tests', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,337875,-0.004549823672974267
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anxiety is characterized by a persistent and disruptive negative emotional state. This proposal will utilize pose estimation algorithms, unsupervised behavioral segmentation, neural population analyses, and simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging and input-specific optogenetic inhibition to investigate the mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety-like emotional states.

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as âabstractâ contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9819777,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,698101,0.04165754632151136
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10050798,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,373940,0.031169214122068165
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,0.020414148740962843
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9882891,F32MH119797,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study models', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2020,20742,0.02337812112603102

"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,0.030360414078148476
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis. We aim to test our central hypothesis that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence that supports multiple confidence-guided behavioral processes.",Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence,10058676,R01MH097061,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Wages', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'deaf', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sound', 'success']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,500079,0.011614044629404302
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these âreal-timeâ pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical âroadblockâ with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9883842,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,400249,0.03510978829461253
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,0.004890975625331871
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on peopleâs lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10068854,F32MH122062,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human Subject Research', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'training project', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,64926,0.025118037571949216
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the modelâs fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimerâs, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9983177,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2020,3062362,0.002309534691532023
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive âneuro-psychometricâ characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9906925,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2020,660316,0.007878716619904861
