"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,-0.02410832080112467
"Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects 65 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients affected do not respond to antiepileptic drug therapy and require a thorough diagnostic work-up. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that often coincide with the seizure focus. However, 20- 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number appears to be growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle gray and white matter network changes on non-invasive, quantitative MRI, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), that can help to delineate the epileptogenic network. Unfortunately, methods for selecting optimal features from sMRI/DTI data in patients with epilepsy that can address these clinical challenges have not been developed. There are at least two major barriers that have limited progress in this field. First, sample sizes have been insufficient to develop reliable classification algorithms in patients with focal epilepsy that lead to reproducible findings. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than 50-60 patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate and cannot adequately model confounds. Second, high computational demands have previously limited the feasibility of using sophisticated, feature-selection (i.e., Machine Learning; ML) algorithms in clinical settings.  A new, large-scale data initiative (i.e., ENIGMA-epilepsy) acquired from 24 sites world-wide is now lifting these barriers and allowing for the development and validation of innovative data-driven approaches aimed at optimizing the use of MRI data in the evaluation of epilepsy. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach that unblocks the power logjam by merging resources, data, capital infrastructure and talents of leading epilepsy centers from 14 countries across the world (2,149 patient and 1,727 healthy control MRI/DTI datasets). We will also leverage new developments in ML (i.e., deep learning) and network-based modeling (i.e., connectome- based approaches) and test whether these novel approaches improve upon classification accuracy relative to simpler, user-driven models. Our primary aim will be to test the ability of our deep learning approach (i.e., dense neural networks) to lateralize the seizure focus. In an exploratory aim, we will test the ability of our model to predict post-operative seizure outcomes. ENIGMA's harmonized approach will allow us to test our approach in over 24 datasets, diverse in age, ethnicity, age of onset, epilepsy duration, and surgical outcomes.  This R-21 application addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly- powered design, and is directly aligned with NINDS's 2014 Epilepsy Benchmarks, which encourage the identification of biomarkers for assessing or predicting treatment response in patients with epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting 65 million people worldwide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how advanced, non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to develop algorithms for (1) lateralizing the seizure focus and (2) predicting favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying novel machine learning algorithms to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with epilepsy and healthy controls, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical diagnostic and treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study,9751025,R21NS107739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Capital', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'brain abnormalities', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized approach', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,444315,0.010251191199185916
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,-0.012277749604536578
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9704042,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2019,189000,-0.04714183625712715
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,9909889,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,34014,-0.061079515368736036
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9821943,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,193536,-0.026591856567670165
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9712062,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,584676,-0.02314858428110137
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,0.023328349759756672
"Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 20 years of empirical data document the individual and societal costs of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although evidence-based treatments are available for SUD+PTSD, the lack of methods or guidelines for personalized treatment recommendations represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Secondary analyses of existing treatment research datasets have the promise to identify cost-effective and noninvasive variables that represent predictors, moderators, mediators, mechanisms of action, and secondary effects in a way that can be easily replicated in research and expanded to the real world. Importantly, extant datasets provide an opportunity to develop and test innovative analytic approaches that leverage technological advances in computing power to: 1) develop precision medicine algorithms that can prognosticate and prescribe at the patient-level, 2) generate new hypotheses to guide future research on treatment development and dissemination, and 3) innovate existing methods that can be applied to solve related problems in the field. Accordingly, the proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for SUD+PTSD in order to: Aim 1: Develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data. Aim 2: Identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the treatment response probability. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of providing data-driven, personalized prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile. The proposed machine learning analyses will be developed by the applicant at the Anxiety and Health Behaviors Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, and evaluated at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which houses the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States of America, and one of the most powerful systems in the world. Importantly, the algorithms (once developed) can be easily disseminated and do not require powerful hardware to execute. Therefore, the combination of advanced machine learning analyses and high-performance computing has the promise to provide methods and findings that can be expanded across extant datasets and future research projects to facilitate scientific discovery in the field of personalized medicine for addiction that: 1) goes beyond comparing mean response across treatments, and 2) that is otherwise not possible with traditional statistical methods. If successful, the project will support a strategy that represents a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all recommendations derived from treatment comparisons in clinical trials, to a data-driven, precision medicine approach that prognosticates and prescribes at the patient level. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the project is successful, it will be the first to: 1) develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data, 2) identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the probability for treatment response, and 3) assess the feasibility of providing data-driven prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile.",Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach,9809511,R36DA049122,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anxiety', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'anxiety treatment', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'societal costs', 'suicidal risk', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R36,2019,49534,-0.06895543598488292
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9724776,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2019,265477,0.019966355368708437
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,0.008522345395439617
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,0.0015238224424773434
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishing a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive neurostimulative or pharmacological therapies.",Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning,9664683,R01NS092882,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Device Designs', 'Dose', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Exposure', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Focal Seizure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychological Impact', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'circadian', 'clinically relevant', 'empowered', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'side effect']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,607609,0.003931587825084112
"Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal is to pursue an independent career in computational psychiatry by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging and data-driven analysis approaches to advance precision medicine in mental health. To build on my strong neuroimaging and computational background, the training component of this award emphasizes coursework and mentorship in the clinical and behavioral aspects of psychopathology. I will also receive mentorship to advance my theoretical and applied understanding of deep learning in this burgeoning field. The overarching research goal in this proposal is to develop computational strategies that account for the heterogeneity of mood disorders to improve the identification of treatment-response biomarkers. Response to pharmaceutical and behavioral antidepressant treatments is low, likely due to the symptomatic and etiological heterogeneity of depression whereby certain treatments may confer differential benefits for patients having particular symptom constellations. In the K99 phase, I will seek to improve prediction of individual antidepressant response using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which elicits robust and rapid antidepressant effects, as the treatment model. I will use MRI and clinical data from patients undergoing ECT collected for the large the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC). In Aim 1, I will use exploratory factor analysis to characterize latent symptom dimensions of the GEMRIC cohort before, during, and after ECT. The accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes along the recovered symptom dimensions will be compared to traditional means of evaluating response using the total score of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Pursuit of this aim will expand my understanding of clinical psychiatry and lay foundational knowledge for the independent aims. Aim 2 will expand my deep learning and multimodal neuroimaging skillsets as I develop novel deep learning architectures to fuse multimodal imaging features of GEMRIC participants to further improve predictions of treatment response and cognitive impairment following ECT. Rather than simply concatenating multimodal features together, deep network architectures will discover latent feature representations. The R00 phase will be a logical progression of the skill sets I develop in the mentored phase and expand on these lines of research. Aim 3 will draw from a collection of large-scale MRI datasets from patients with more broadly defined mood disorders to identify multimodal imaging markers associated with transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 4 uses treatment groups from aim 3, including patients undergoing ketamine, sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmaceuticals, to explore the extent to which biomarkers of therapeutic response, defined along the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions identified in Aim 3, are shared across treatment groups. I anticipate that discrete categorizations of mood disorders artificially obscures discovery of treatment-response biomarkers. Fulfillment of these aims will simultaneously propel me to independence and yield important insight into the treatment of heterogeneous mood disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mood disorders including depression, bipolar, and post-traumatic stress disorder constitute the world's leading cause of disability and their burden is increasing. This proposal seeks to mitigate the burden of these related mood disorders by identifying patterns of brain structure and function indicative of a patient's likelihood of benefiting from various related interventions.

"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,0.007008633559108439
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9785626,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,158696,0.015109782209515657
"Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring Project Summary Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are caused by a number of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens and pathogen identification is needed to administer the correct treatment. However, due to the lagtime in standard biochemical assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, clinicians have come to depend on broad-spectrum, empirical treatment which contributes to both drug resistance and patient death. The goal of this project is to develop a breath test for rapid pathogen identification and treatment monitoring in ARI to facilitate more immediate, targeted treatment in the clinic. The current proposal is focused on bacterial pathogen identification with future goals to expand to viral and fungal pathogens. Substrate cleavage assays are currently used to query bacterial protease activity and can be used to rapidly and accurately classify bacteria down to the species level. Leveraging the protease-responsive nanosensor platform in the Bhatia lab, the goal of this proposal is to develop inhalable multiplexed nanosensors that release volatile reporters into the breath in response to infection- associated proteases in the lung. From there, we can generate breath “fingerprints” for pathogens common in ARIs such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae). Furthermore, changes in proteolytic activity after the start of antimicrobial treatment can be used to generate a “good response” and “poor response” breath signature for more timely evaluation of drug efficacy. To this end, the specific aims of this project are the following: (1) establish a volatile- barcoding system for peptide substrates (2) build and validate an inhalable multiplexed system of protease nanosensors for pathogen identification and (3) investigate use of multiplexed protease nanosensors for monitoring response to antibiotic treatment. Aim 1 will be completed by identifying volatile reporter candidates that can be attached to peptide substrates without deleterious effects on cleavage kinetics, protease specificity, and breath signal. Once identified, volatile reporters will be isotope-labeled to create a panel of reporters with similar volatility differing only by mass. Peptides with orthogonal susceptibility to host and pathogen proteases will then be identified in Aim 2 by screening a peptide library against bacterial culture supernatants and bronchioalveolar lavage from infected mice. Peptides will then be barcoded using the VOC mass labels designed in Aim 1 and then formulated into inhalable nanosensors by attachment to a nanoparticle core. The resulting nanosensor panel will be delivered via intratracheal injection into mice infected with one of the six VAP pathogens. Machine learning will be used to generate a statistical classifier to identify pathogens based on reporter levels in breath and will be used to further identify reporter signatures for good and poor response to antibiotic treatment. Successful completion of these aims would result in a diagnostic platform that can potentially be expanded for rapid identification of an exhaustive list of respiratory pathogens, including viral and fungal pathogens. Rapid identification of the cause of respiratory infection is necessary to prescribe the correct drugs for treatment. In the following work, we propose to develop tiny, inhalable bacteria sensors for a breathalyzer test that would enable rapid identification of infectious bacteria in the lung. This would allow the correct drugs to be prescribed and prevent antibiotic overuse which contributes to the growing problem of drug resistance.",Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring,9805608,K99EB028311,"['Acute respiratory infection', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Pneumonia', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'Breathalyzer Tests', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inhalation', 'Injections', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Label', 'Leukocyte Elastase', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Randomized', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'exhaustion', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'nanosensors', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'portability', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'resistant strain', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'targeted treatment', 'thioester', 'urinary', 'vapor', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'volatile organic compound']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,87484,-0.01629742057573793
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,-0.005144670417575042
"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9766229,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'clinical implementation', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2019,517281,-0.04762813753591524
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,9721392,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2019,226659,-0.003064573231136129
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,0.010999891544401123
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9742524,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,659674,0.009938662785078057
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Headaches', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'side effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,-0.008127025441593699
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9739188,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,506426,0.011274712720275106
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,0.01213987045618341
"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9742306,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126700,-0.004274422202822809
"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9646600,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'polypeptide C', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2019,193783,0.02589709713996365
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes.

"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients. These studies hold potential for helping us understand and identify those patients at greatest risk of HRCP and subsequent heart attacks and death, and to evaluate the biological reasons that these patients develop HRCP.",Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque,9817023,R01HL146145,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'coronary plaque', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'neglect', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1485906,-0.015370786460223109
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,-0.0018970132087756636
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, “uniqueness”, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patient’s genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9721702,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2019,237402,-0.0493993406546423
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,0.006578813484216658
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,0.017583906642512467
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,0.026217911882395667
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,-0.008279429009380565
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.01641552994555313
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9678366,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,602448,0.015376841197105957
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,496653,0.005322365634173027
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,-0.0201144855581347
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9672582,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170639,-0.007445241876475946
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,0.015520286443025904
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,9816774,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'proteostasis', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2019,518325,0.013149775196246358
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9781704,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,254179,0.018495958179468794
"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. The tremendous heterogeneity of ARDS has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to address ARDS mortality and all therapies currently employed in ARDS management are generic. The critical care community suffers from a lack of empirical data and tools that would allow identification of ARDS sub- phenotypes and potentially identify individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. This Phase I STTR leverages substantial complementary expertise to establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that will be used to stratify subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes and develop a predictive platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon entry into the ER or ICU.

"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes” defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care. Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, due partly to the fact that existing antidepressants are not effective for all patients and it is often challenging to match individual patients to the treatments that are most likely to help them. This project will test a new strategy for using fMRI brain scans to predict antidepressant response and assist clinicians in choosing which of two antidepressant treatments— transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting one of two depression-related brain areas—is most likely to benefit an individual patient.",Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression,9648914,R01MH118388,"['Accounting', 'Aftercare', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'anxious', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical predictors', 'comparative efficacy', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy trial', 'electric field', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tractography', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,1245371,-0.00766052241699168
"Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is often guided by risk stratification tools (to decide who to treat), and randomized controlled trials (to decide which treatments to select). Prior CVD research reveals two major  obstacles to improving our treatment approach: (i) longitudinal cohort data are unavailable for recalibrating risk stratification tools for local-area estimation (by zip code), or for people with major CVD-promoting  comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease); and (ii) the average treatment effect in randomized trials can be highly erroneous when projected onto individuals that vary from the ‘average’ participant in a trial. CVD risk- stratification and treatment effect estimation can be improved and personalized if we overcome a critical barrier to progress: correctly estimating risk and treatment effect from new, large participant data repositories, which have greater population size and include patients with more co-morbid conditions than common cohort studies, and which permit personalized risk/benefit prediction tool development from individual-level data. Our prior studies show that we can critically advance the field by applying novel statistical learning methods to this data, to address: (i) false-positives from multiple testing; (ii) the reliance on standard regressions that cannot account for non-linear, complex interactions between factors; and (iii) identifying the optimal approach among many alternative statistical learning methods. We propose to apply our work in these areas to (Aim 1) Develop CVD risk stratification tools for patients with inadequate sample sizes in common cohort studies. We will enhance CVD risk stratification to include local-area adjustment (by zip code) and major co-morbid conditions affecting CVD risk (e.g., chronic kidney disease). We will additionally (Aim 2) develop personalized treatment effect  prediction tools to guide decisions for CVD therapies with high potential benefit and risk, for therapies where  individual participant data from trials are available. We have obtained the individual participant data from the large randomized trials that reveal wide variations in CVD risk reduction and serious adverse event risk increase from three drug classes: non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, intensive blood pressure treatment, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for diabetes. Our preliminary research shows that traditional  regression methods cannot distinguish which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed by such therapies, but our statistical learning methods can. Finally, we will (Aim 3) develop open-source tools to improve the ability of researchers to choose an optimal statistical learning approach for their dataset and problem. While numerous statistical learning methods have been proposed in the literature, a key problem for biomedical scientists  without access to RCT data is: which method should I use to estimate treatment effects from observational data? Building on our innovative approach to identify the optimal inference method for observational data, we will construct an open-source tool to compare methods, identifying which method most often results in optimal treatment decisions that minimize error and maximize performance on standardized metrics. Public health relevance  Using current cardiovascular disease risk stratification tools, about 31.6 million Americans will receive an incorrect cardiovascular disease risk estimate that will lead to wrong treatment, per current guidelines.  Furthermore, extrapolating the average treatment effect for major preventive cardiovascular disease treatments— rather than calculating a personalized risk/benefit score—contributes to 4.9 million serious adverse events from treatment complications each year. In this project, we seek to address both problems: improving  cardiovascular disease risk stratification, and developing personalized calculators for risk and benefit of major  cardiovascular disease treatments.",Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment,9637461,R01HL144555,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Fasting', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Sizes', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Reduction', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Sodium', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical care', 'data warehouse', 'editorial', 'fasting glucose', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'stroke risk', 'symporter', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,774381,-0.027718434098222458
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9682509,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,743707,-0.003910902525769074
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9688116,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,275934,0.004484703914697378
"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,-0.009876448445144943
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['Applications Grants', 'Bayesian Prediction', 'Blood Component Removal', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Inferior', 'Infusion procedures', 'Link', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nomograms', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'autologous lymphocytes', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'fundamental research', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'radiation effect', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety study', 'side effect', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,-0.019927599902140103
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9660276,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,-0.015760372511261726
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes.

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,0.015955377136733697
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,-0.02410832080112467
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9517942,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'recruit', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,193750,0.010020471607412861
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9480874,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2018,187699,-0.04714183625712715
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9564111,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564228,0.0015238224424773434
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,-0.018000068892710885
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy.

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9549036,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'clinical implementation', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,517281,-0.04762813753591524
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. ! Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9527395,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,165149,0.015109782209515657

However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of gadolinium –based contrast agents (GBCAs). Thus, there is critical need for identifying active lesions without the use of GBCA. In this application we propose to identify the active lesions without administering GBCA using texture analysis (TA) using multi- modal non-contrast MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. A unique feature of this proposal is that the results will be analyzed using MRI data acquired on a large cohort of MS patients (~1000) as a part of phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (CombiRx). In addition texture features will be identified that can predict lesions that convert into tissue destructive lesions, so called black holes. This has important clinical implications since there is correlative evidence that balk holes are associated with clinical disability. A novelty of this project lies in performing texture analysis in real time that allows the physician to make the decision about administering GBCA on the spot while the patient is still in the scanner. This greatly helps in eliminating and/or minimizing the number of times GBCA needs to be administered. For real time analysis, the necessary infrastructure that includes automatic processing pipeline and integration of the MRI scanner with high performance computational resources located at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin. Finally to establish real time TA as a viable alternative to GBCA administration for identifying active lesions, the developed methods will be prospectively applied to MS patients undergoing MRI scans as a part of routine clinical management. Public health relevance: Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used for identifying active lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of GBCA. This proposal uses novel real time analysis for identifying lesions that are likely to enhance on pre- contrast MRI. Considering the large number of MS patients who are frequently scanned with GBCA, this proposal has a high degree of clinical relevance.",Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis,9650821,R56NS105857,"['Advanced Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Spottings', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'attenuation', 'austin', 'base', 'black hole', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'contrast enhanced', 'density', 'disability', 'high end computer', 'imaging facilities', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prospective', 'public health relevance']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R56,2018,535749,-0.002196924990985611
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,-0.006025998449744976
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,0.01213987045618341
"Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety Project Summary / Abstract Biomarkers have transformed the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions. In contrast, psychiatric biomarkers remain largely elusive, due in part to the fact that there is a weak correspondence between psychiatric diagnoses and their neurobiological substrates. This is especially true for depression and anxiety disorders, clinically heterogeneous conditions associated with abnormal reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli—and to the cues that predict them—and varied patterns of dysfunction in neural circuits that process positive and negative valence. This project will investigate how arousal processes interact with VS circuits to influence the anticipation and experience of rewarding and aversive stimuli in patients seeking treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety, independent of conventional diagnostic categories. It is specifically designed to advance the goals of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project, by focusing on four related RDoC constructs that are directly germane to this question—arousal, potential threat threat, approach motivation, and reward attainment—and testing whether they explain variation in symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia in clinical populations. Importantly, this project will also advance RDoC's goal of developing new ways of classifying mental disorders, which will ultimately require methods for identifying novel diagnostic classes linked to homogeneous pathophysiology. To this end, we will test a strategy for discovering novel diagnostic subtypes defined by clustered patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in valence system circuits. We will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to develop classifiers for diagnosing these subtypes in individual patients, and we will seek to identify distinct mechanisms by which atypical valence system reactivity may contribute to anxiety, anhedonia, and abnormal approach motivation and avoidance behavior in distinct patient subgroups, indexed in the laboratory via integrated, convergent measurements across multiple units of analysis. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and targeting treatments to the patients most likely to benefit from them. In contrast, biomarkers for psychiatric disorders remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of depression and anxiety in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific clinical profiles of anxiety, reward processing, and anxious arousal within these subtypes.",Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety,9733429,R56MH114976,"['Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stimulus', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Variant', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'approach avoidance behavior', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer therapy', 'connectome', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward processing', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2018,724068,0.010743953007794592
"Retinal eye-tracking for the prognosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis Abstract The goal of this project is to validate an innovative, highly sensitive retinal eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, namely multiple sclerosis (MS). The applications of effective treatments for multiple sclerosis are constrained by (1) the absence of methods for early detection and (2) quantitative, highly sensitive methods monitoring deficits early in disease course when treatment may have a better chance of success. As already demonstrated, the TSLO is capable of rapidly assessing and measuring the extraordinarily fine, microscopic motion of the human eye during fixation in MS patients. Fixational eye movements are neurally-encoded, involuntary movements that require the coordination of many areas of the central nervous system. Given the TSLO’s theoretical sensitivity to change (0.2 arcminutes) and its precision of measurement - fixational eye movements have the potential utility for tracking neurodegenerative disease progression at an unprecedented scale. With the advent of the new FDA-approved MS treatment targeting B-cells (ocrelizumab), clinical tools are now desperately needed to not only assess treatment efficacy, but to objectively assess patient disability at the earliest stage of disease in order to cut relapse rates and prevent irrevocable disability. In this project, we will determine the optimal fixational eye motion metrics to distinguish patients from controls, establish the relationship between clinical disease severity measures and fixational eye movement deficits as defined by the TSLO system, and to use machine learning algorithms to further strengthen our fixational metrics. Narrative The goal of our project is to clinically validate a retinal imaging and eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9567622,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,659674,0.009938662785078057
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9570304,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,528639,0.011274712720275106
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9501679,R44AI124766,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Laboratories', 'Latin American', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Messenger RNA', 'Middle East', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Northern Africa', 'Nurses', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'infancy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimmunology', 'phase 1 study', 'preservation']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,320550,0.025247668828865814
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,0.006578813484216658
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,-0.009876448445144943
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9473087,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,601486,0.015376841197105957
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,0.023328349759756672
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9555179,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,498258,0.005322365634173027
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9515521,R01HL115828,"['4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,704597,-0.0201144855581347
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,-0.008279429009380565
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,0.015835585183820017
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9503881,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2018,170640,-0.007445241876475946
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9521079,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,735068,-0.003910902525769074
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9548457,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,273031,0.004484703914697378
"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9521026,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Supervision', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,253287,0.018495958179468794
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,9410515,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,323434,-0.0364697131200646
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state.

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,-0.027799922421782284
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,-0.015760372511261726
"Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018 Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare inherited neurocutaneous disease characterized by ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, intellectual disability, and a distinctive retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in ALDH3A2, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. Despite knowing the gene defect and enzyme abnormality, the pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear and no single biomarker exists that correlates with disease severity. FALDH deficiency results in several lipid abnormalities including accumulation of fatty aldehydes, which have potential toxic effects via formation of covalent adducts with proteins and lipids. This unusual lipid abnormality has the potential to affect multiple unrelated cellular pathways that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Our recent metabolomic studies in SLS have identified a unique biochemical profile of at least 30 metabolites in plasma that suggests disruption of several previously unsuspected pathways. We now propose to mine our STAIR 7004 clinical database of 20 SLS patients together with their associated metabolomic data to develop a minimal “metabolomic profile” that will correlate with severity of clinical symptoms and function as a reliable biomarker. These studies will utilize various statistical analytical methods, including principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and random forest analysis, to define a minimal group of clinically informative metabolites, representing multiple biochemical pathways, for construction of a SLS metabolomic profile. When completed, this research will provide an objective biomarker for SLS disease description and therapeutic monitoring. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spasticity, intellectual disability and a distinct retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in a gene called ALDH3A2 and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. The pathogenic mechanisms that are responsible for the symptoms are still not defined. The proposed research will investigate whether a distinctly abnormal group of biochemicals in the blood, which constitute a “metabolomics profile”, will correlate with the severity of symptoms in patients and thereby act as an objective biomarker for disease severity.",Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018,9719054,U54HD061939,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital ichthyosis', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Acids', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lipids', 'Little&apos', 's Disease', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Neurocutaneous Syndromes', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Specimen', 'Sterols', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'adduct', 'analytical method', 'biomarker identification', 'fatty aldehyde', 'forest', 'isoprenoid', 'lipid metabolism', 'long-chain-aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'response', 'spasticity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2018,58479,0.0009186578865491166

"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,-0.015413429612882766

"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients. This project expands the development of a comprehensive screening platform to rapidly identify the most promising therapy for individuals with cystic fibrosis.","Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients",9533194,R44HL130189,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bicarbonates', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Couples', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Face', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Morphology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Organoids', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sputum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Transportation', 'VX-770', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'chronic infection', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical predictors', 'combinatorial', 'commercialization', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'novel', 'particle', 'phase 1 testing', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,"PATH BIOANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2018,799989,-0.010611073455095661
"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients.",Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),9345675,R43HL135909,"['Acute Lung Injury', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Berlin', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'ICD-9', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'software systems', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,149470,-0.023390874740885446
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9298423,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,232500,0.010020471607412861
"Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment Abstract Depression treatment is effective for approximately 50-60% of patients who receive treatment, but the probability of a successful response is typically unknown before treatment begins. As a result, depression treatment is routinely delivered in a trial-and-error fashion until a satisfactory response is achieved. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel, non-linear combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. This statistical approach considers many prediction variables simultaneously and iteratively constructs a complex prediction model that often dramatically outperforms traditional statistical methods. Aim 1 is to apply stochastic gradient boosted decision trees to predict response to citalopram using archival data from the STAR*D clinical trial. In preliminary analyses, we randomly selected 1223 patients to train the model and another 407 patients to independently test the model (a 75-25 split), with tuning parameters selected by cross-validation to minimize log-loss. The resulting prediction on the independent test sample was superior to the no-information rate (p < 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 66%. Although this level of prediction is significantly better than a no information model, we plan to improve the model's prognostication by 1) adding features that capture the “pharmacological noise” of concurrent (non- study) medication use and 2) updating model predictions based on early signs of response. Aim 2 is to use a similar machine learning approach to examine response to internet-based CBT for depression. Internet-based treatments for depression are growing in popularity, provide efficient access to health care, reduce treatment costs, and have good evidence for treatment efficacy. Importantly, we have a large dataset (N = 1,013) within which to develop treatment-matching algorithms that predict treatment response based on patient attributes. Study Impact: The overarching goal of this project is to use machine learning methods to develop treatment matching algorithms. In the long term, we can envision a system that evaluates a patient on a number of important predictor variables and provides a personalized probability of treatment success. These probabilities would then be used to guide treatment selection or modify current treatment if a poor response is predicted. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient with a given set of attributes would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.   Public Health Narrative Depression treatment is effective for roughly half of the patients who receive treatment, but it is usually unknown how a specific patient with a particular set of attributes will respond to a given treatment. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9316700,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical imaging', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2017,187400,-0.04714183625712715
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9390382,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'capillary', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,559269,0.0015238224424773434
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?"" This is a crucial step in the management of chronic disease, such as depression, for which a large number of variables are collected over time, by facilitating the construction of a parsimonious clinical decision system.",Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome,9334312,R21MH108999,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'preference', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'simulation', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,240000,0.017267739027619525
"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9334170,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,517281,-0.04762813753591524
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome.

"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,0.014512518548972059
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,-0.006025998449744976
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,0.01213987045618341
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9382777,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,711253,0.009938662785078057
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,0.006578813484216658
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9405679,R44AI124766,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Laboratories', 'Latin American', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Messenger RNA', 'Middle East', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Northern Africa', 'Nurses', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'infancy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimmunology', 'phase 1 study']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2017,504933,0.025247668828865814
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9535613,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2017,365626,-0.009876448445144943

Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9238054,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,360556,-0.009876448445144943
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9310591,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,607934,0.015376841197105957
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,-0.008279429009380565
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,0.015835585183820017
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9274155,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2017,269514,0.004484703914697378
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group.

"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods are motivated by the need to develop new neuroimaging-based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS), but can be applied to other types of brain diseases including stroke, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.",Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies,9378514,R01NS060910,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal database', 'neuroimaging', 'non-Gaussian model', 'personalized approach', 'repaired', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,659178,-0.013757303872989603
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,-0.005191961100220646
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9265960,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,577180,0.018564325654202185
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,-0.027799922421782284
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9338285,R01HL115336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anatomy', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,557344,0.005409561805111547
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies.

"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will use already collected data on existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease. The knowledge gained will help guide treatment strategies and improve prognosis assessments.",Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD,9440672,R21HL140376,"['Age', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Distal', 'Early treatment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data space', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metabolomics', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,117278,-0.08175777633228791

In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,-0.0014475137112117658
"Software Platform to Stratify Patients for Treatment Arm Randomization in Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Predictive Models ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Since Riluzole was approved in 1995, over 30 late-phase clinical trials have failed and no additional medications have been approved for ALS. While death from ALS averages 3 to 5 years from onset of symptoms, disease progression displays wide heterogeneity. A typical year-long clinical trial can have 20 to 25% of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all. Several meta-analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity. It is clear that current statistical tools are inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression. Using the recently available ALS PRO-ACT data set, our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge. Since the contest, we have significantly improved the algorithm, built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools. The goal of this grant is to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical trial sites. This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications. The key innovation of this work, as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial, but rather by predicted outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being tested. An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention. This work will focus on the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that, compared to traditional randomization strata, randomization strata defined by predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period. Aim 2: Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive algorithm to be used by on-site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials. The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression predictions. These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled, simulated and analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools, not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes, hospital-acquired infections, heart disease and cancer. NARRATIVE This work will develop a prototype to test the use of patient disease progression predictions made by machine learning models as a new way of randomizing clinical trials.

"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients. This project expands the development of a comprehensive screening platform to rapidly identify the most promising therapy for individuals with cystic fibrosis.","Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients",9385159,R44HL130189,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bicarbonates', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Couples', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Face', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Morphology', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Organoids', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sputum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Transportation', 'VX-770', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical predictors', 'combinatorial', 'commercialization', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'novel', 'particle', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,"PATH BIOANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,799995,-0.010611073455095661
"Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment Abstract Depression treatment is effective for approximately 50-60% of patients who receive treatment, but the probability of a successful response is typically unknown before treatment begins. As a result, depression treatment is routinely delivered in a trial-and-error fashion until a satisfactory response is achieved. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel, non-linear combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. This statistical approach considers many prediction variables simultaneously and iteratively constructs a complex prediction model that often dramatically outperforms traditional statistical methods. Aim 1 is to apply stochastic gradient boosted decision trees to predict response to citalopram using archival data from the STAR*D clinical trial. In preliminary analyses, we randomly selected 1223 patients to train the model and another 407 patients to independently test the model (a 75-25 split), with tuning parameters selected by cross-validation to minimize log-loss. The resulting prediction on the independent test sample was superior to the no-information rate (p < 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 66%. Although this level of prediction is significantly better than a no information model, we plan to improve the model's prognostication by 1) adding features that capture the “pharmacological noise” of concurrent (non- study) medication use and 2) updating model predictions based on early signs of response. Aim 2 is to use a similar machine learning approach to examine response to internet-based CBT for depression. Internet-based treatments for depression are growing in popularity, provide efficient access to health care, reduce treatment costs, and have good evidence for treatment efficacy. Importantly, we have a large dataset (N = 1,013) within which to develop treatment-matching algorithms that predict treatment response based on patient attributes. Study Impact: The overarching goal of this project is to use machine learning methods to develop treatment matching algorithms. In the long term, we can envision a system that evaluates a patient on a number of important predictor variables and provides a personalized probability of treatment success. These probabilities would then be used to guide treatment selection or modify current treatment if a poor response is predicted. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient with a given set of attributes would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.   Public Health Narrative Depression treatment is effective for roughly half of the patients who receive treatment, but it is usually unknown how a specific patient with a particular set of attributes will respond to a given treatment. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.  ",Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment,9168157,R21MH110758,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Citalopram', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychologic', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2016,234375,0.014166545573946063
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability.

"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques.

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9120824,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,504687,-0.04762813753591524
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,-0.007730226782358142
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,0.014512518548972059
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,0.01213987045618341
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,0.01834115654955258
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,0.0003975583072496608
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This research proposal aims to better understand the emergence of multiple chronic conditions by identifying and predicting emerging diseases in young adults and discovering the patient characteristics associated with comorbidity emergence and progression.            ",A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions,9074366,SC2GM118266,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'data mining', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'multitask', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC2,2016,147000,-0.007648752301942723
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,-0.008279429009380565
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9106828,R01AR068456,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,31678,0.004484703914697378
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,0.02417242377258588
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,-0.005191961100220646
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI.

A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9067927,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,461274,0.02417242377258588
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,9197415,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'genetic approach', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,247500,-0.004650639804559439
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,0.018564325654202185
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,0.005409561805111547
"Naltrexone Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response. We will provide clinically- relevant interpretations to cross-cultural clinical practice, and assess potential use in a larger multi-country study.

"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,9122467,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,107290,0.009280769975231973
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,9084580,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,229139,-0.02962061858190583
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2. Develop classification system of morphological changes in IPF visualized by SHG. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Narrative Idiopathic fibrosis (IPF) patients have poor survival rates and there is also a lack of diagnostic/prognostic tools that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to evaluate changes in collagen in the extracellular matrix.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.            ",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,8955720,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2015,544862,-0.04762813753591524
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,0.01213987045618341
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,0.014512518548972059
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,0.01834115654955258
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,-0.009690059716385277
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,-0.008279429009380565
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition,8792219,R01EY022039,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Noise', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,379750,-0.009720824967255744
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,-0.0364697131200646
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,0.0032422777793306157
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,0.02417242377258588
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,0.018564325654202185
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,0.005409561805111547
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8775184,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'genetic approach', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,362076,-0.004650639804559439
"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner.

"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.            ",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,8956609,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,107290,0.009280769975231973
"Naltrexone Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response. We will provide clinically- relevant interpretations to cross-cultural clinical practice, and assess potential use in a larger multi-country study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment; and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,8866409,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,229139,-0.02962061858190583
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,-0.006386824854959726
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,0.014512518548972059
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thalamus plays a key role in integrating sensory information for further processing in the basal ganglia and cortex. In multiple sclerosis (MS), long thought to be primarily a white matter disease, it has recently been shown that cognitive decline is more strongly related to thalamic volume than to white matter magnetic resonance image (MRI) lesion load. Since the thalamus is made up of nuclei having specific physical connections within the brain, it may be possible to relate physical changes in thalamic nuclei caused by MS to specific cognitive, behavioral, or disease subtype differences. This grant proposes to develop an automated method and associated software tool to carry out thalamic nuclei parcellation using MRI. Specifically, it is proposed to: 1) optimize the computation of thalamic features from anatomical and diffusion MRI; 2) develop an integrated, multi-nuclear thalamus segmentation algorithm; 3) optimize the algorithm parameters using manual delineations; and 4) carry out a pilot study using an existing MRI database comprising 99 normal controls and 226 MS patients. The work builds on previous methods that exploit topology and connectivity in order to improve segmentation robustness. The primary innovation is to provide a coordinated multi-object approach that integrates intensity information from T1-weighted MRI with orientation information and connectivity information obtained from diffusion MRI. Primary diffusion directions will be mapped to a five- dimensional space in order to cluster nuclei by diffusion orientation and use this information in the parcellation algorithm. A machine learning approach applied to manual delineations will be used to learn boundary-specific properties that will be used to carry out a joint parcellation approach. The algorithm will be designed for conventional three tesla clinical MRI and will be validated using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio seven tesla MRI on 15 subjects scanned contemporaneously with their three tesla scans. The pilot study will use 822 scans of 305 participants, and will examine longitudinal stability of the algorithm and a cross-sectional univariate statistical analysis relatng thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) volumes to various clinical measures including disease subtype, disease duration, visual acuity, and two standard MS composite disability scores. An exploratory principal component analysis of multiple thalamic nuclear volumes will be carried out to look for patterns of atrophy and their relationships to various clinical measures. The algorithm will be made publicly available as open source code on the NITRC website so that the entire neuroscience community will be able to use the algorithm to study other diseases or modify and extend it for other applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the automatic segmentation and measurement of thalamic nuclei, which are thought to be affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). With this software applied to clinical magnetic resonance scans, the size of the thalamus and its nuclei will be available as biomarkers to track both the progression of MS and the success of its treatment.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,-0.036759125390836644
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,0.02417242377258588
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,0.018564325654202185
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.            ",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8586243,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,367264,-0.004650639804559439
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease.

This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8392109,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,552793,-0.006386824854959726
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,0.014512518548972059
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thalamus plays a key role in integrating sensory information for further processing in the basal ganglia and cortex. In multiple sclerosis (MS), long thought to be primarily a white matter disease, it has recently been shown that cognitive decline is more strongly related to thalamic volume than to white matter magnetic resonance image (MRI) lesion load. Since the thalamus is made up of nuclei having specific physical connections within the brain, it may be possible to relate physical changes in thalamic nuclei caused by MS to specific cognitive, behavioral, or disease subtype differences. This grant proposes to develop an automated method and associated software tool to carry out thalamic nuclei parcellation using MRI. Specifically, it is proposed to: 1) optimize the computation of thalamic features from anatomical and diffusion MRI; 2) develop an integrated, multi-nuclear thalamus segmentation algorithm; 3) optimize the algorithm parameters using manual delineations; and 4) carry out a pilot study using an existing MRI database comprising 99 normal controls and 226 MS patients. The work builds on previous methods that exploit topology and connectivity in order to improve segmentation robustness. The primary innovation is to provide a coordinated multi-object approach that integrates intensity information from T1-weighted MRI with orientation information and connectivity information obtained from diffusion MRI. Primary diffusion directions will be mapped to a five- dimensional space in order to cluster nuclei by diffusion orientation and use this information in the parcellation algorithm. A machine learning approach applied to manual delineations will be used to learn boundary-specific properties that will be used to carry out a joint parcellation approach. The algorithm will be designed for conventional three tesla clinical MRI and will be validated using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio seven tesla MRI on 15 subjects scanned contemporaneously with their three tesla scans. The pilot study will use 822 scans of 305 participants, and will examine longitudinal stability of the algorithm and a cross-sectional univariate statistical analysis relatng thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) volumes to various clinical measures including disease subtype, disease duration, visual acuity, and two standard MS composite disability scores. An exploratory principal component analysis of multiple thalamic nuclear volumes will be carried out to look for patterns of atrophy and their relationships to various clinical measures. The algorithm will be made publicly available as open source code on the NITRC website so that the entire neuroscience community will be able to use the algorithm to study other diseases or modify and extend it for other applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the automatic segmentation and measurement of thalamic nuclei, which are thought to be affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). With this software applied to clinical magnetic resonance scans, the size of the thalamus and its nuclei will be available as biomarkers to track both the progression of MS and the success of its treatment. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.            ",Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS,8583135,R21NS082891,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Equilibrium', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solvents', 'Source Code', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Diseases', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tremor', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'gray matter', 'illness length', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'success', 'web site', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,196835,0.0028621722779566274
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8483561,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,324656,-0.036759125390836644
"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.        The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,0.005409561805111547
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.            ",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8438156,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,373745,-0.004650639804559439
"Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic, inflammatory disease that primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding tendons and ligaments. This often very painful and debilitating disease affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, of which about 70% are women. 10% of affected subjects suffer total disability. Over the last decade there have been considerable advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The use of biologic agents that antagonize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has resulted in decreased morbidity as well as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of RA patients, ranging from 20% to 50% in clinical trials, failed to mount a robust clinical response to these agents. Given the very high cost and potential serious toxicities associated with TNF antagonists, identification of predictors of the response to TNF antagonist therapy would help to optimize the clinical management of RA patients.  Novel optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods have been developed in recent years and are currently tested for various clinical application ranging from breast cancer imaging to imaging of brain activities. This novel technology promises to offer new insights into the various disease processes without the use of ionizing radiation at a relatively low cost. The group of Dr. Hielscher has recently shown that OTI is particularly sensitive to small changes in finger joints affected by RA. These changes manifest themselves in differences in the optical absorption and scattering coefficients inside these joints, which come about by changes in the optical properties of the synovial fluid as well as the vasculature surrounding the joints.  We hypothesize that optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods will be able to detect changes occurring in arthritic joints that are treated with TNF antagonist within the first few months or even weeks of treatment initiation. Therefore, the specific aim of this revision application is to perform a longitudinal observational pilot study with 20 RA patients to identify optical imaging biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment outcome. In particular we expect that patients who respond to the treatment will show an increase in the variation of the scattering and absorption coefficient across the joint. In addition, both absorption and scattering coefficients will decreas. In patients for whom treatment response is not observed, no changes will be observed over the course of the treatment. A successful study would provide preliminary data for a more extensive grant application by a newly formed interdisciplinary team of NIAMS researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful and debilitating disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans. The last decade has seen the development of a new group of RA drugs called biologic response modifiers or biologics that can greatly improve the quality of life. However, not all patients respond to these new drugs and given the very high cost and potential serious side effects it is highly desirable to find biomarkers that can predict f a patient will respond to a particular drug or not. We propose to test in a clinical pilot study involving 20 RA patients, if a novel optical imaging system can be used to predict treatment outcome within a few weeks of treatment initiation.            ",Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA,8585677,R01AR050026,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Applications Grants', 'Arthritis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Optical Methods', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Synovial Fluid', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'absorption', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'college', 'cost', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rheumatologist', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,147421,0.004116371286709563
"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA.

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this STTR project, we present EyeMark, a set of tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy using retinal image photographs. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in monitoring progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research. There is ample published evidence that MA turnover rates are a good predictor of likelihood of progression to more severe retinopathy, establishing MA turnover as an excellent biomarker for diabetic retinopathy. Measuring this quantity involves two steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual MAs. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done by entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the above limitations by automating both the steps involved in MA turnover measurement: accurate image registration, and MA detection. We will develop end-too-end desktop software for automated computation of MA turnover and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor diabetic retinopathy progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.              The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Predicting and Detecting Glaucomatous Progression Using Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to improve glaucoma management by applying novel pattern recognition techniques to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. The premise is that complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and that advanced pattern recognition techniques can find and use that hidden information. The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.              The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.              Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.

"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.           The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.         ",Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma,8114413,R21CA152775,"['Address', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logic', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metastatic to', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'editorial', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'lymph nodes', 'melanoma', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,193798,-0.010269096664804899
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.        Disclaimer:  Please note that the following critiques were prepared by the reviewers prior to the Study Section meeting and are provided in an essentially unedited form.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,8136044,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,354969,0.022577113670964127
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,7929626,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,146808,0.022577113670964127
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision.

"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments.  PROJECT RELEVANCE  Crouch gait is one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Surgeries are frequently performed in an effort to improve crouch gait, but it is difficult to predict which patients will benefit from these procedures because the biomechanical factors that cause crouch gait are unknown.

"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       n/a",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7896842,R21DK075868,"['Alabama', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Circulation', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glycopeptides', 'Goals', 'IgA1', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Western Blotting', 'base', 'cohort', 'complement C3 precursor', 'design', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'molecular mass', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2010,183125,0.017723919983936107
"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,8250047,R01NS062885,[' '],NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,126061,0.022577113670964127
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7846704,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'base', 'blind', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein profiling', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2009,19341,0.019546781335670012

An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,7783946,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275625,0.022577113670964127
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia.

"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7640849,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'design', 'disease classification', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,207225,0.030696724862848978
"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments. The positive economic impact of this project is to maintain employment for the project participants. We have already lost one talented bioengineer, F.E. Anderson, because of the funding gap in this project arising from severe NIH paylines.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       n/a",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7386943,R21DK075868,"['Alabama', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Circulation', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glycopeptides', 'Goals', 'IgA1', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Western Blotting', 'base', 'cohort', 'complement C3 precursor', 'design', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'molecular mass', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2009,219500,0.017723919983936107
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,-0.004188380188690804
"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,0.015155152220822483
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7501971,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,136830,0.019546781335670012
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.          n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7522303,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2008,868308,-0.03263168490109131
"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7531854,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'disease classification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,172688,0.030696724862848978
"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7388981,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2008,124583,-0.00917859168606669
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7434510,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,181300,0.01325047247172641
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,-0.004188380188690804
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,0.015155152220822483
"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33]. R21 aim one is to automate serum sample processing and analysis; aim two is to automate all data processing, to examine pattern selection and sample class prediction methods, and to integrate all software platforms; aim three is to develop routine MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS sequencing of 'barcode' peptides. R33 aim one is to define reproducibility of serum patterns in patients with  thyroid disease; aim two is to determine barcodes that can distinguish patients with thyroid cancer from those with benign thyroid nodules; aim three is to assess if serum peptidome barcodes can identify occult metastasis in a large group of thyroid cancer survivors.         n/a",Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma,7259406,R33CA111942,"['Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Goals', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Diseases', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'prototype', 'sample collection']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RES,R33,2007,307752,-0.02373013273211392
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. These studies will demonstrate the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; multi-focal visual evoked potential, mfVEP) compared to optical imaging techniques (confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry) and ganglion cell-specific perimetry (short wavelength and frequency doubling perimetry) for glaucoma detection.

Findings will be important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.                n/a",Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology,7242398,R21EY018190,"['Address', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroretinography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photography', 'Psychophysiology', 'Range', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Scotoma', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Suspect Glaucomas', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'response', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'stereoscopic', 'vector']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,R21,2007,218125,-0.03881894817847065
"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7313388,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2007,223880,0.019546781335670012
"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7239204,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2007,127125,-0.00917859168606669
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,0.01325047247172641
"Generalization of the Client Matching Protocol    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal tests the generalization of a standardized client-treatment matching interview and decision-tree algorithm (the Client Matching Protocol, or CMP) through an 18-month secondary analysis of the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS) database. The investigative team's previous study of Therapeutic Community (TC)-oriented agencies found that clients entering outpatient and residential treatment settings in which there was a concordance with the CMP algorithm (matched clients) showed significantly higher rates of treatment completion and long-term retention than clients entering settings that were discordant with the CMP algorithm (mismatched clients). The present study uses the DATOS variables to recreate the CMP algorithm. The study extends the previous research by 1) testing the generalization of the CMP to non-TC residential and outpatient programs, 2) determining the effect of matching on treatment process, and 3) testing the generalization of the matching effect to one- and five-year treatment outcomes. Additional research questions explore the extension of the CMP algorithm to short-term residential and methadone outpatient treatment, and to the interaction between the CMP match and organizational and client variables. Non-parametric statistics, ANOVA, logistic and multiple regression, and Structural Equation Modeling test the effects of matching and the interaction of matching and the program and client characteristics. The present study contains important research and clinical implications. This 18-month study contains significant implications for both treatment and research in that it will provide empirical clarification of whether and how matching contributes to treatment improvement.

"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33].

"Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Foot ulceration is a diabetic complication that results in over $1 billion worth of medical expenses per year in the United States alone. To better quantify the external forces involved in ulceration, researchers are developing new hardware systems that can measure both shear stress and vertical pressure. As these systems are commercialized, visualization software will be required for display and analysis of the 3-D stresses acting on the plantar surface. The proposed research will develop an advanced foot pressure and shear data visualization system, based on the innovative use of a deformed 2-D wire mesh to indicate stress, combined with more traditional vertical elevations and color-coding to indicate pressure. This new software will be adaptable to a variety of measurement systems, and will allow a clinician to see an accurate, 3-D representation of the maximum pressure and shear locations on the plantar surface. Also, novel analysis algorithms will be developed to identify areas where skin pressure and stress patterns (e.g., bunching, shearing, or stretching) are most likely to cause pathological consequences. Availability of this advanced software, in combination with new pressure/shear hardware measurement systems, will greatly improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: According to the American Diabetes Association, there are approximately 16 million patients in the United States with diabetes, with 800,000 new diagnoses each year.  For these patients, foot complications account for more hospitalizations than any other clinical problem, and plantar ulcerations are a major reason for subsequent foot amputation.   The proposed research will lead to a new commercial software product aimed primarily at the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.   In addition, product applications can be extended to the estimated 1 million patients per year who develop pressure ulcer bedsores, as well as to prosthetic limb patients who are at risk of skin breakdown due to peripheral vascular disease. n/a",Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System,6443499,R43DK061164,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomechanics', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decubitus ulcer', ' foot', ' mechanical pressure', ' mechanical stress', ' monitoring device']",NIDDK,"FOSTER-MILLER, INC.",R43,2002,119415,-0.0007430541336238667

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,-0.008955626971724648
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority.

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,9864905,R01EY030929,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'base', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,400056,0.0023524853759789585
"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10055661,K99EY030942,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Frequencies', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Probability', 'Progressive Disease', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'South Korea', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'college', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'field study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'legally blind', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,117347,-0.03580431682117053
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD. The analytic approach can be applied to other eye diseases where large-scale genetics and/or image data are collected.",Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data,10056062,R21EY030488,"['Achievement', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Eye diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'data warehouse', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fundus imaging', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'public repository', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'synergism', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,188198,-0.023425143761627933
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,0.023328349759756672
"Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal is to pursue an independent career in computational psychiatry by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging and data-driven analysis approaches to advance precision medicine in mental health. To build on my strong neuroimaging and computational background, the training component of this award emphasizes coursework and mentorship in the clinical and behavioral aspects of psychopathology. I will also receive mentorship to advance my theoretical and applied understanding of deep learning in this burgeoning field. The overarching research goal in this proposal is to develop computational strategies that account for the heterogeneity of mood disorders to improve the identification of treatment-response biomarkers. Response to pharmaceutical and behavioral antidepressant treatments is low, likely due to the symptomatic and etiological heterogeneity of depression whereby certain treatments may confer differential benefits for patients having particular symptom constellations. In the K99 phase, I will seek to improve prediction of individual antidepressant response using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which elicits robust and rapid antidepressant effects, as the treatment model. I will use MRI and clinical data from patients undergoing ECT collected for the large the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC). In Aim 1, I will use exploratory factor analysis to characterize latent symptom dimensions of the GEMRIC cohort before, during, and after ECT. The accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes along the recovered symptom dimensions will be compared to traditional means of evaluating response using the total score of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Pursuit of this aim will expand my understanding of clinical psychiatry and lay foundational knowledge for the independent aims. Aim 2 will expand my deep learning and multimodal neuroimaging skillsets as I develop novel deep learning architectures to fuse multimodal imaging features of GEMRIC participants to further improve predictions of treatment response and cognitive impairment following ECT. Rather than simply concatenating multimodal features together, deep network architectures will discover latent feature representations. The R00 phase will be a logical progression of the skill sets I develop in the mentored phase and expand on these lines of research. Aim 3 will draw from a collection of large-scale MRI datasets from patients with more broadly defined mood disorders to identify multimodal imaging markers associated with transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 4 uses treatment groups from aim 3, including patients undergoing ketamine, sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmaceuticals, to explore the extent to which biomarkers of therapeutic response, defined along the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions identified in Aim 3, are shared across treatment groups. I anticipate that discrete categorizations of mood disorders artificially obscures discovery of treatment-response biomarkers. Fulfillment of these aims will simultaneously propel me to independence and yield important insight into the treatment of heterogeneous mood disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mood disorders including depression, bipolar, and post-traumatic stress disorder constitute the world's leading cause of disability and their burden is increasing. This proposal seeks to mitigate the burden of these related mood disorders by identifying patterns of brain structure and function indicative of a patient's likelihood of benefiting from various related interventions. This research has the potential to inform more personalized treatment strategies than are currently available and will likely further inform development of precision interventions targeting mood disorders.",Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders,10011838,K99MH119314,"['Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Etiology', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleeplessness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'antidepressant effect', 'anxious', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'hippocampal morphometry', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'network architecture', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2020,102857,0.00293923179036578
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9878810,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,490133,-0.02314858428110137
"The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a rigorously experimentally validated all-atom computational model of the cardiac thin filament (CTF) bound to myosin S1 which provides a unique and accessible platform to identify novel, high resolution disease mechanisms linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the prior funding period, we refined and extended our existing CTF computational model and successfully employed it to identify unique and clinically relevant allosteric disease mechanisms including HCM mutation-induced changes in myofilament Ca2+ kinetics, mutation-specific molecular causes of differential cardiac remodeling and disease progression. This included an in vivo validation via the development of a novel transgenic mouse model of cTnT-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and a predictive algorithm to determine the pathogenicity of cTnT mutations that out-performed existing computational approaches in a preliminary test. The key to these advances has been the ability of the current model to precisely identify and locate allosteric changes caused by mutations throughout all components of the CTF followed by closely coupled experimental validation and eventual in vivo model correlation. We now propose to significantly expand the biological complexity of the model to include myosin S1, the molecular motor that drives contraction and the second most common genetic cause of HCM. This important and challenging advance will facilitate a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis by, for the first time, incorporating the role of molecular allosteric mechanisms between myosin S1 and thin filament. This new computational – experimental platform will be used for both mechanistic insight (for example used for the identification of novel myofilament disease targets,) and the development of a comprehensive deep-learning predictive algorithm to assign pathogenicity to both myosin and thin filament HCM mutations. The latter represents the first use of high-resolution structure, dynamics and function to predict HCM disease allele pathogenicity, a central challenge in the clinical management of these complex patients. Both the training and testing components of the deep learning development will utilize data from the highly annotated and curated SHaRe HCM registry thus greatly improving translational power. Two Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will utilize state of the art rare event simulation methods developed in one of our groups and refinement of existing unstructured domains of the CTF via FRET to establish the new model. Aim 2 will employ an extensive program of computational analysis and subsequent in vitro validation using pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and non- pathogenic HCM alleles derived from SHaRe to provide inputs to the machine learning environment for algorithm development. Novel disease mechanisms for myosin and thin filament HCM that include crosstalk between the two components will also be explored. Elucidation of these mechanisms can be the basis for robust molecular approaches to disease. Precision medicine and “molecular” medicine are concepts that aim to employ a patient’s genetic structure to discern the best medical treatments for disease.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life.

"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,-0.0135467714865841
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,-0.012882468107832728
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9995010,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,-0.026591856567670165
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,0.007008633559108439
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9912204,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2020,207977,0.019966355368708437
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10019347,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34768,-0.061079515368736036
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections. We will use this method to gain a better understanding of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and cerebral blood flow, and expect that our method will have multiple applications beside Parkinson’s disease.",Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease,9968566,R01NS112233,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'deep learning', 'feeding', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'perfusion imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular factor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,348762,-0.007507801167155836
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9952373,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal macula', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'retina circulation', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564228,0.0015238224424773434
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements. The proposed methodology will provide reproducible, automatic and low-cost prognostic in-vivo biomarkers of emphysema progression that may enable the discovery of new therapies and translate them into clinical practice. Project Narrative Computed tomographic assessments of emphysema progression based on emphysema subtyping and lung mechanical strain biomarkers in the COPDGene study may provide insight into its prognostication.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,0.008522345395439617

At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9843746,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'support vector machine', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2020,193783,0.02589709713996365
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10013198,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2020,187049,-0.003064573231136129
"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4. Refine numerical (FEM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of the depth-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the cornea. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will focus on the development of novel technology and methods for noninvasive assessment of biomechanical properties of the cornea. Development of such a technique would significantly advance our understanding of the corneal disorders, allow developing novel clinical therapies and interventions, and improve outcome of current surgical ant therapeutic interventions.",Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea,10063805,R01EY022362,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Agreement', 'Air Pressure', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Ants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Keratoconus', 'Knowledge', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myopia', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Routine Diagnostic Tests', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tunic', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'crosslink', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mechanical properties', 'models and simulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'physical property', 'pressure', 'response', 'success', 'viscoelasticity', 'visual tracking']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,410000,-0.006252488802670155
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9994391,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,162343,0.015109782209515657
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening Imaging biomarkers are features in images that have biological implications. For example, in a picture of a person with red hair, the red hair is a feature and the implication is that there is a mutation in the MC1R gene that provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This feature, an imaging biomarker, can be used as a medical cue to indicate increased risk for melanoma. When used in this context, this imaging biomarker becomes an imaging biomarker cue (IBC), in the sense that it may cue the medical professional observer to alter treatment accordingly, such as recommending sunscreen use. IBCs do not individually bear the full weight of medical decision-making and instead are integrated. IBC analysis may be a process of sensory cue integration or may be a process of observation and integration by technology such as a digital camera and computer. An advantage of the latter is that computational scalability enables machine vision to compute vast permutations of IBCs that would be overwhelming to a human observer. Thus computers can try many potential diagnostic methods rapidly before picking the best one to teach back to humans. The purpose of this project is to develop a human/machine interface for bi-directional teaching so expert dermatologists can teach computers what IBCs they use to achieve accurate diagnosis and computers can teach dermatologists the best way to use current IBCs and suggest integration of new IBCs that machine learning guides them to. As an outcome, we will measure the diagnostic performance of dermatologists who undergo IBC training in detecting melanoma. It is known that early detection saves lives, but the potential of technology to improve early detection, a great need since 10,000 Americans still die each year from melanoma, is unknown. This project will help answer that unknown and if we are successful in translating IBCs with commuter vision and machine learning, more melanomas will be detected early and lives will be saved. Our long-term goal is to reduce melanoma related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by helping clinicians increase the predictive value of dermoscopy-based melanoma screening. We believe sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy- based melanoma screening for non-expert screeners can be improved by assistive technology, which is highly desirable given the cost of false positives (patient stress and unnecessary biopsies) and the extremely high cost of false negatives (delayed melanoma treatment). This project creates a technology to help medical personnel see and integrate features of abnormal skin spots that help them determine if the spot they are looking at is a melanoma. Since melanoma is deadly if left untreated, this technology helps them guide biopsy and surgical removal of skin to potentially cut more melanomas out (saving lives) and not cut so many benign lesions out unnecessarily (leaving less scars). Our augmentation of vision and cognition uses machine learning in a way that is visually intuitive so physicians may be able to show their patients the rationale behind the choice to surgically excise abnormal skin spots or not to.",Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening,10025420,R21CA240254,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement Factor D', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melanocortin 1 Receptor', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mole the mammal', 'Mutation', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Skin', 'Skin Abnormalities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'melanoma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'vector']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,412585,-0.007798457668089877
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,-0.06199209884372347
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,9889390,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,200007,0.005071751291658352
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,9865565,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,700225,0.006201816929195372
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program.

"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics. We propose to use multiple types of biologic data to identify different COPD subtypes, which may be important for disease prognosis and treatment.",Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,9975882,K08HL136928,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Expert Opinion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'SNP array', 'Severities', 'Spirometry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'machine learning method', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,172800,0.003090780501662912
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,0.006578813484216658
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,-0.005144670417575042
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Attenuated', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'data harmonization', 'digital', 'disability', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,-0.00047569839545395564
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10060889,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,757956,0.01374511338783978
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,0.0023872289796696873
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,0.002215572154262384
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,-0.00970663887388011
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,0.010999891544401123
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9928348,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,126700,-0.004274422202822809
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10071621,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,770947,-0.039026967036446446
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9981804,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,601275,0.011274712720275106
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes ABSTRACT As the rapidly unfolding COVID-19 pandemic claims its victims around the world, it has also inspired the scientific community to come up with solutions to meet an urgent and unmet need —i.e., ameliorate the severity of Covid- 19 and reduce mortality. Two obstacles make that task difficult—First, the pathophysiology of Covid-19 remains a mystery; the emerging reports generally agree that the disease has a very slow onset and that those who succumb typically mount a ‘cytokine storm’, i.e., an overzealous immune response. However, despite being implicated as a culprit behind the observed mortality and morbidity in COVID-19, we know virtually nothing about what constitutes (nature, extent) or contributes to (cell or origin) such an overzealous response. A significant number of patients have GI symptoms. The treatment goals in COVID-19 have been formulated largely as a ‘trial and error’-approach; this is reflected in the mixed results of the trials that have concluded. Second, the process of drug discovery is comprised of time-consuming steps; to avoid delays, we need to define the nature of the fatal cellular response before deciding how to model it in animals or matching therapeutics to curb it.  Our preliminary work has helped us define the aberrant host cellular response in COVID-19. We used machine learning tools that can look beyond interindividual variability to extract underlying gene expression patterns within complex data across multiple cohorts of viral pandemics, including COVID-19. The resultant pattern, i.e., signature, was subsequently exploited as a predictive model to navigate COVID-19 for GI symptoms. Surprisingly, the 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, inspiring the nomenclature-- (ViP)-signature. The ViP signature identified and predicted the disease severity of SARS-CoV2-infected patients. We hypothesized that the ViP signature provides a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the cellular response in viral pandemics and could serve as a powerful unbiased tool in our armamentarium to vet candidate drugs rapidly. In this proposal, our predicted model, experimental datasets and the information from published literature will be used to screen drugs/nutritional components/probiotics in the GI organoid derived monolayers in a semi-HTP format. We will experimentally validate the effect of the therapeutics predicted in ViP gene signature of the host. The following two aims will provide a translational impact on the COVID-19 emergency. Aim 1: Identify the gastro-intestinal pathogenic pathways during COVID-19. Aim 2: Determine the impact of drugs, nutrients and supplements in gut-in-a-dish model of COVID-19. Impact: This proposal will identify the gastro-intestinal pathways (in healthy and patients with chronic diseases) involved in the GI symptoms of COVID 19 and provide new treatment options in COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to rapidly claim lives and challenge the limits of our knowledge and our healthcare system. Other than “cytokine storm,” a significant amount of the patient shows gastrointestinal symptoms and nothing is known for the cellular pathways and any relevant treatment of COVID-19. The published literature, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided approaches, and our experimental datasets with GI- organoid-based cell models are used to identify host gastrointestinal pathways that can be targeted using drug/pro-prebiotics and nutritional supplements to combat the disease.",Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes,10177672,R01DK107585,"['2019-nCoV', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Duodenum', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enteral', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Esophagus', 'Feces', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'IL8 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Lower Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Nausea', 'Neutral Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Nomenclature', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prodrugs', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Stomach', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'VIP gene', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'cohort', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'dietary supplements', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'genetic signature', 'gut microbiota', 'ileum', 'intestinal epithelium', 'microbial', 'monolayer', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'prebiotics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'transmission process', 'viral RNA', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,354469,-0.007841270525251295
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10042756,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69810,-0.012614735321214128
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Antibodies as Drugs ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs organized by Drs. Pierre Bruhns, Patrick C. Wilson, Esther Breij and David P. Humphreys. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from January 27-30, 2021. Therapeutic antibodies continue to largely populate the list of top biologic drugs. They revolutionize the treatment of pathologies falling into major disease areas, which include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. As more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, there has also been a concomitant increase in the frequency of resistance and escape mechanisms. Thus, researchers are exploring alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, not only are new methodological and technological advances being developed, paradigm-shifting concepts are being developed in order to face these challenges. This conference in the Keystone Symposia series on Antibodies as Drugs aims to present the state-of-the-art in antibody therapeutics, repertoires and deep learning, bispecific antibodies and engineering. This conference will provide a forum for extensive interactions between investigators from both industry and academia. Goals of this conference include discussion of recent breakthroughs in identifying therapeutics from patients, understanding vaccination and mode of delivery, modalities for half-life extensions and involvement of complement in antibody mode of action. It is anticipated that research in the field will showcase the rise of bispecific antibodies and highlight the technologies to develop them, improve their functionalities, and boost clinical efficacies, particularly in immune-oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The success of early antibody approaches has been tremendous and now they have revolutionized treatment for many major disease areas, such as cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. However, as more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, then more resistance and escape mechanisms are being found, forcing scientists to search for alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, this conference will gather scientists from many different disciplines, including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine, to share ideas and help develop novel antibody therapeutics.",Antibodies as Drugs,10071067,R13AI154980,"['Academia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bispecific Antibodies', 'British Columbia', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Extension', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccination', 'antibody engineering', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'posters', 'prevent', 'resistance frequency', 'success', 'symposium']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,11500,-0.01594549031434344
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,9966041,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2020,516549,0.013149775196246358
"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance. Strabismus is a common clinical disorder that can cause double vision in adults and vision loss in children. Strabismus is often treated by surgical manipulation of the eye muscles, although current knowledge of their structure and function is incomplete. Proposed functional imaging and biomechanical studies of the properties of the eye muscles, eyeball, and optic nerve will improve understanding of the causes and treatment of strabismus, optic nerve diseases, and nearsightedness.",Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery,9972266,R01EY008313,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biomechanics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Child', 'Choroid', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative Myopia', 'Diplopia', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Esotropia', 'Etiology', 'Exotropia', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gap Junctions', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myopia', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Ocular orbit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Play', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Property', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Sclera', 'Strabismus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'anatomic imaging', 'biomechanical model', 'cell motility', 'crosslink', 'digital imaging', 'ex vivo imaging', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'in vivo optical imaging', 'kinematics', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'monocular', 'neglect', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'orbit muscle', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'simulation']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,622245,-0.04011148664211913
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9942277,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,658144,0.009938662785078057
"Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations Project Summary The spleen plays a key role in the human immune system but also clears senescent red blood cells (RBC) from the circulation and those altered by acquired or inherited diseases. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is one of the first targets of pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. Under hypoxic conditions, mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes to fibers which increase both the stiffness and adhesion of RBC. Splenic filtration of altered RBC prone to sickling (a process that cannot be directly observed in human subjects) contributes to anemia and likely triggers acute splenic sequestration crises (ASSC). On the other hand, it potentially prevents complications associated with intravascular sickling. Self- amplified blockade of vessels with sickled RBCs is indeed a hallmark of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute hepatic crises, that severely impact the life quality and expectancy of patients with SCD. We propose to formulate and validate a new predictive modeling framework for how the spleen filters altered RBC in SCD by synergistically integrating in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data using multifidelity-based neural networks (NN). This will deliver predictive models that can continuously learn when new data become available, a paradigm shift in biomedical modeling. We will develop multiscale/multifidelity computational models (and corresponding NN implementations) that link sub-cellular, cellular, and vessel level phenomena spanning across four orders of magnitude in spatio-temporal scales. This scale coupling will be accomplished using a molecular dynamics/dissipative particle dynamics (MD/DPD) framework. We will validate these predictive computational models by data from in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and RBC quantitative features collected in SCD patients. Specifically, we will use three new spleen-on-a-chip microfluidic devices with oxygen control and the unique human spleen perfusion setup of our foreign partner, with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a splenic inter-endothelial slit filtration model; Aim 2: Develop new models of RBC macrophage adhesion and of phagocytosis in the spleen; Aim 3: Perform Spleen-on-a-Chip experiments and validation; Aim 4: Validate the predictive framework based on RBC samples from patients. Realization of our four Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of the complex pathogenic and protective roles of the spleen in SCD. Feeding our new multifidelity neural networks with morphological and functional measures of RBC circulating in SCD patients will lead to models for residual spleen function in SCD, which should help predict the risk of acute splenic sequestration crises, and guide optimal timing for Stem Cell Transplantation or Gene Therapy. The new paradigm in using deep learning tools to integrate data from different sources will be applicable to modeling many other blood diseases. Project Narrative In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is the target of early pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. We will formulate and validate predictive multiscale models for red blood cell (RBC) filtration by the spleen based on new deep learning neural networks fed with data from simulations, experiments using new spleen-mimetic microfluidics, and RBC quantitative features from ex vivo perfusion of human spleens and from SCD patients. These models will be used to predict acute splenic sequestrations crises and guide treatment decisions in patients with SCD.","Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations",10052044,R01HL154150,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Adhesiveness', 'Adhesives', 'Anemia', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Endothelium', 'Erythrocytes', 'Expectancy', 'Fiber', 'Filtration', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hepatic', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hereditary Spherocytosis', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Paris, France', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phagocytosis', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Spleen', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Training', 'Validation', 'acute chest syndrome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'ex vivo perfusion', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'learning progression', 'macrophage', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neural network', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'retention rate', 'senescence', 'sickling', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'vaso-occlusive crisis']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,705243,-0.028400814341503412
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9979980,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'feature selection', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,81671,0.028766093131548258
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments.

"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10039145,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Elements', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'design', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'foot', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'performance tests', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'processing speed', 'prognostic', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'walking speed']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,199260,0.01628537386187718
"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,9861454,R01HL150147,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Birth', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Lung', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rod', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Vital capacity', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'health assessment', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment effect', 'ventilation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,799509,-0.0107815636157871
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, “uniqueness”, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patient’s genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9953933,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,185591,-0.0493993406546423
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,-0.0018970132087756636
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,0.015520286443025904
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,-0.028997460884838493
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients. These studies hold potential for helping us understand and identify those patients at greatest risk of HRCP and subsequent heart attacks and death, and to evaluate the biological reasons that these patients develop HRCP.",Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque,9984529,R01HL146145,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'coronary plaque', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'neglect', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1438818,-0.015370786460223109
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9975215,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170639,-0.007445241876475946
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data. We are requesting an MALDI imaging source unit to attach to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra- High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) to validate our ongoing NMR studies and accelerate the translation of our biomarker discoveries to the clinical realm.",Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping,10175695,R01GM120033,"['2019-nCoV', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Equipment', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologist', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'animal tissue', 'automated algorithm', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cell type', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'human disease', 'instrument', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted imaging', 'tissue regeneration', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,209619,-0.016056534648342027
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,-0.02389580973392177
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,9943464,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,800637,-0.010976436130356815
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9985102,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,603973,0.017583906642512467
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,0.026217911882395667
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,-0.04658982826589544
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,-0.016587352197641077
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,0.009931519142436366
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,0.008843118694166287

We propose to identify alterations in the plasma metabolome of patients experiencing different levels of severity of COVID-19. Such changes should be pivotal in allowing the prediction of the severity of the patient COVID-19 symptoms and also provide mechanistic information about the disease and its progression. In addition to our expertise in metabolomics, we are able to carry out this project because we have access to samples from the Yale New Haven Hospital System via the IMPACT Biorepository. This repository stores human specimens related to emerging respiratory viral infections (with a particular focus on COVID-19) in order to support research on factors related to viral expression, transmission, disease severity, progression, and susceptibility. The directors of the biorepository are co-investigators in this supplement. As such, we are in unique position to perform this novel research because we have: (a) the infrastructure to conduct the metabolomic analyses and we have already developed the methodologies, (b) access to COVID-19 patient plasma samples stored at the IMPACT (Implementing medical and public health actions against coronavirus in Connecticut) Biorepository (and associated patient records), (c) assembled an extraordinary team that includes expertise in metabolomics, virology, pulmonary and infectious disease, and immunology. of this supplement current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is of major concern because (i) it is highly contagious, (ii) it a spectrum of adverse health consequences (collectively known as COVID-19) that range from mild symptoms (fever, chills, cough) to life-endangering pneumonia and SARS, and (iii) there is no effective or vaccine to prevent it. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had devastating effects on public with an international mortality rate of 5.8% in infected individuals.

"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome.

Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9903426,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,747084,-0.0201144855581347
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,393957,-0.01697169420201521
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.0051640604340957305
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9840512,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,816340,-0.003910902525769074
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10048017,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2020,103817,-0.004078114936115673
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,-0.031354231377141537
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers.

"Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%. Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes, leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3) Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of cerebrovascular changes PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous when they rupture. When one is detected, it may be treated or monitored through imaging, with aneurysm growth a strong indication of increased risk of rupture. This project will study how remodeling in the arteries of the Circle of Willis associates with aneurysm growth, and how blood flow may determine locations of remodeling, in order to identify new biomarkers to improve tracking and assessment of aneurysm progression.",Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans,9947821,R01HL152270,"['Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Cell Death', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arterial tortuosity', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical risk', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'sex', 'shape analysis', 'shear stress', 'side effect', 'tool', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,693928,0.012075843948392704
"Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments Project Summary Combining comparative effectiveness research (CER) and dissemination and implementation research is playing an increased role in public health and health care service by allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about treatments and improving adoption of evidence-based practices. In circumstances where CER questions do not lend themselves to direct experimentation or in implementation trials where incomplete adoption of in- tervention occurs, causal inference tools for “ﬁeld data” are recommended for evaluating treatment effects. The increased complexities in large national electronic health databases pose challenges for statistical analyses and demand approaches beyond conventional causal inference techniques, which have traditionally focused on bi- nary treatment. Given the wealth of information captured in large-scale data, it is rare that treatment regimens are deﬁned in terms of two treatments only. The data are typically pooled from treating facilities across the nation with considerable variability in the institutional effect. Although it has been established that popular tools for bi- nary treatment are inappropriate for the multiple treatment setting, and that ignoring the multilevel data structure can bias the estimate of the treatment effect, few alternative methods have been proposed to deal with both complications simultaneously. The ﬁrst aim of our proposed project is to develop a novel and ﬂexible Bayesian approach to estimating the causal effects of multiple treatments on survival with clustered data. We then fully investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed method in a variety of simulated scenarios and contrast it with approaches often used in practice. For causal estimates to be unbiased, researchers commonly make the assumption of no unmeasured confounding (UMC). Though highly recommended with binary treatment, there is no known implementation or framework for sensitivity analysis with multiple treatments and multilevel survival data. The second aim of our project is to develop and apply a ﬂexible and interpretable Bayesian approach to assessing the sensitivity of causal estimates to possible departures from the assumption of no UMC, at both cluster- and individual-level. This approach is capable of gauging the amount of unobserved confounding needed to change the direction of the observed treatment effects Our project will apply the developed methods in the ﬁrst two aims to a large representative high-risk localized prostate cancer population, drawn from the National Cancer Data Base, to evaluate the average causal effects of three popular treatment options on survival and evaluate how unmeasured confounding might alter causal conclusions. We also will estimate treatment heterogeneity and identify distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is effective or harmful. Our methods will establish the effectiveness component and lay the groundwork for building the cost-effectiveness models, and provide evidence for further investigations of variations in intervention implementation and modiﬁcations in recommendations for treatments leading to different patient outcomes. To facilitate the dissemination of our work, we will share the underlying statistical code via an R package. Project Narrative As public health comparisons often involve more than two treatments on patients from multiple care centers, comparative effectiveness research and implementation research call for advanced causal inference techniques allowing for the estimation of multiple treatment effects while respecting the multilevel data structure. We de- velop a new approach to simultaneously contrast the effectiveness of multiple treatments on clustered survival outcomes, propose and apply a new framework for testing the assumptions behind these estimates, and propose a strategy for estimating treatment effect heterogeneity and identifying distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is harmful or effective. Our work will provide practitioners clarity with respect to estimating causes and effects from complicated health care databases in which the comparative assessment of multiple treatment options from multilevel survival data is challenging but imperative.",Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments,10056850,R21CA245855,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Androgens', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brachytherapy', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Code', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'comparative', 'complex data ', 'cost effectiveness', 'data structure', 'data tools', 'deprivation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,459480,-0.0027046628673769915
"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets.

"A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilous for the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues.  COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g. loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs. There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.  To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming. These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks.  The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptionally detrimental for the elderly, as they comprise 80% of deaths in the US and are at elevated risks for serious physical and mental health issues due to social isolation. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits a range of diverse symptoms, demanding a precision medicine approach in which treatments for each distinct outcome are developed, biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification into an outcome group are defined, and new candidate drug targets are generated for each outcome. In order to lay the foundation for a precision medicine approach for treating COVID-19, this work will generate a highly-phenotyped large-scale omics dataset including blood proteomics and metabolomics from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 uninfected healthy individuals and will intensely analyze these data using diverse complementary high-performance computing techniques, including network modeling with enhanced accuracy, explainable-AI systems biology incorporating diverse data, and pioneering linear programming producing optimal associations, thereby illuminating complex proteomic and metabolomic biomarker patterns associated with each critical disease outcome and generating novel candidate drug targets.",A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,10202278,RF1AG053303,"['2019-nCoV', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood coagulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Programming', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mutate', 'Natural Selections', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shock', 'Smell Perception', 'Social isolation', 'Solid', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'computing resources', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'fighting', 'human old age (65+)', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor', 'response', 'statistics', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,650002,-0.002645301164748714
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9911975,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'patient response', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,276227,0.004484703914697378
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,0.009415129789518546
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,-0.018094514552614436
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9869041,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,9973645,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,527040,-0.03495865004871878
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,9998187,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,824479,-0.0122310744582066
"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,9975580,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,189108,-0.02092684498878131
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9996319,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical trial participant', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2020,1202772,-0.015413429612882766
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,0.015955377136733697
