"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,9976740,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,299197,0.03062232842229826
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID Â·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis Abstract  In this SBIR project, we propose EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated retinal im- age capture and analysis system, comprising a self-driven, robotic fundus camera plat- form for automated image capture and a deep learning-based image analysis engine for generation of automated screening outcome. With the large, growing, and aging popula- tion and the increased prevalence of diabetes, a large number of people are at risk for vision loss due to several eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Although eye screening is effective in re- ducing vision loss, there are not enough clinical personnel and eye-care experts for pop- ulation-wide eye screening. Recent advances with automated image analysis are helping alleviate the situation, but they are still limited by the need for good quality images of the patients captured by trained technicians or expensive retinal cameras equipped for auto- mated capture. EyeScreenBot will be developed to provide a truly end-to-end screening solution that is cost-effective and suitable for deployment in primary care clinics or op- tometrist sites, addressing both automated capture and subsequent automated analysis, all without the need for trained technicians or eye experts at the point of care. When deployed and commercialized, this device will rapidly aid scaling of eye screening for the masses, thereby having an enormous impact in improving the quality and accessibility of eye care and helping reduce preventable vision loss. Narrative EyeScreenBot, an end-to-end automated screening system with intelligent image capture and analysis, will truly enable eye screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent since the population at risk for preventable vision loss due to retinal diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) is growing at a staggering rate. Triaging and identification of at-risk patients will allow for timely intervention to prevent, slow, or even reverse the disease progression and loss of vision.",Automated end-to-end retinal screening system with robotic image capture and deep learning analysis,9847891,R43EY029652,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'aging population', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'retinal imaging', 'robot interface', 'robotic system', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2019,218618,0.019510972848455068
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user's location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user's location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user's trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings.

"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on âfluoro huntingâ and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,9806153,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,238182,0.033256417098657724
"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.

"Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy Project Summary/Abstract Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve which is accompanied by visual ï¬eld (VF) loss. While accurate VF loss diagnosis and the detection of its progression over time is of high relevance to clinical practitioners as it indicates the initiation of or change in ocular therapy, there is no consensus on objective measures for this purpose, and VF measurements are known to be often unreliable. The main objective of this project is to develop clinically applicable measures to improve the diagnosis of glaucomatous VF loss and of its progression by two approaches: First, the identiï¬cation of representative loss patterns and their progression, achieved by large-scale, customized bioinformatical procedures applied to data from glaucoma patients from nine clinical centers and second, the inclusion of eye and patient speciï¬c personalized parameters. In total, 480,486 VFs, are available for this project. One major aim is to develop novel diagnostic indices based on computationally identiï¬ed evolution patterns of VF loss, particularly (1) an index that denotes the probability of glaucomatous vision loss and (2) an index that assigns probabilities to a VF that follow-up measurements will be in a certain defect class. The indices will be statistically evaluated on separate VF samples and compared to existing approaches. Routinely available patient speciï¬c parameters which are candidates to impact glaucomatous vision loss are patient ethnicity, type of glaucoma, spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive error and the location of the blind spot relative to ï¬xation. The effect of these parameters on the vision loss patterns will be systematically studied. The impact of their inclusion in the novel diagnostic indices and their potential improvement on glaucoma diagnosis will be quantiï¬ed on a separate data set. A further aim is the calculation of a spatial map speciï¬c to a measured VF that represents the preferred VF locations of future defects as well as their reliability as an aid to event-based progression diagnosis. A second major objective is the investigation of the relationship of VF loss and individual parameters related to retinal structure, based on retinal nerve ï¬ber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements around the optic disc. The inter-relationship of representative patterns of RNFLT and its decrease over time with trajectories of major retinal arteries, SE, and blind spot location is systematically studied, and the impact on patterns of VF loss is quantitatively analyzed with the goal to improve the interpretation of existing VF loss and to predict future glaucomatous vision loss. Main contributions of the project with relevance to clinical practice are publicly available open-source software implementations of new diagnostic indices and maps, enhanced by individual functional and structural parameters, and a detailed and personalized model for the relationship between retinal structure and glaucomatous vision loss. Project Narrative Glaucoma is an ocular disease accompanied by vision loss which may progress over time up to total blindness, but the assessment of glaucomatous vision loss is noisy, and it is often hard for clinical practitioners to decide whether changes over time reï¬ect true changes of functional vision or are the result of normal measurement variations or artifacts. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the impact of individual anatomical parameters on the spatial patterns of glaucomatous vision loss in order to improve the diagnosis of vision loss and of its progression. Main objective of the project is the development of new quantitative diagnostic indices, implemented as publicly available software.",Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy,9802123,R01EY030575,"['Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Axon', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blindness', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Refractive Errors', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Defect', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'central retinal artery', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'fovea centralis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'optic nerve disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sample fixation', 'sex']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,534037,0.03675299510016596
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases usersâ independence by responding to them without another personâs intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the userâs position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the userâs body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains oneâs ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9750520,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2019,507856,0.06435273286949501
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9653180,R01EY025332,"['3-Dimensional', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,416574,0.10439295473597135
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis. This proposal aims to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement, and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use with 4-9 year-old children in the SmartPlayroom. !",Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom,9507909,R21MH113870,"['9 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automated Annotation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'eye hand coordination', 'flexibility', 'frontier', 'grasp', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'research and development', 'sample fixation', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,203125,0.061269416502692194
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9525940,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial disorder', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'procedure cost', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2018,154777,0.02147676605699528
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the userâs location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the userâs location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the userâs trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9499823,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radiofrequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416374,0.12049896054627313
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogicaâs proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties â with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment.

"MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Project Summary The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of highest quality and publications which promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the field produced by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, the Visualization in Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS), which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted intervention & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry. The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendance typically includes more than 45 countries, with strong student representation (~40%). The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain in September 16th-20th, 2018. An innovative aspect of MICCAI 2018 is the initiation of a âMentoring Programâ to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of âWomen in MICCAIâ committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student travel awards to specifically enhance diversity in conference attendance, including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases usersâ independence by responding to them without another personâs intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the userâs position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the userâs body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains oneâs ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9644103,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2018,519349,0.06466833436535172
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9438535,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416574,0.10439295473597135
"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  The ongoing transition to the use of digital documents on computers and mobile devices brings about new opportunities for customizing text for people with visual impairment.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,9133939,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Hand functions', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Subconscious', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'robot control', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,133916,0.10489340473158461
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9215686,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2017,59383,0.07845590194903015
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis.

"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9387016,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Procedures', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2017,168654,0.02147676605699528
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases usersâ independence by responding to them without another personâs intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the userâs position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the userâs body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains oneâs ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9407137,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2017,159267,0.06466833436535172
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9238777,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,416574,0.10439295473597135

"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8989105,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2016,230563,0.03743706381043723
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9030162,R01EY025332,"['3D Print', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,416574,0.10439295473597135
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8813596,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2015,59383,0.07845590194903015
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8916115,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,368560,0.11380510139348801
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8837582,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2015,59966,-0.015105862264668903
"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.                ",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8812658,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2015,191510,0.03743706381043723
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.             ",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,8838311,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Build-it', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Glass', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,155663,0.10489340473158461
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8628140,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2014,59383,0.07845590194903015
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,0.008491794486063796
"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Vision and Hearing Impairment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is estimated that by 2030, more than one in five people in the United States will be over the age of 65.  Age- related hearing and vision loss is considered a natural consequence of the aging process, yet current assistive technology approaches do little to address this type of sensory loss.  The proposed research will test the feasibility of incorporating visual information in hearing aids, which is expected to improve speech perception for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations, greatly enhancing their ability to lead independent lives, remain employable, and maintain active participation in society.                ",Video-based Speech Enhancement for Vision and Hearing Impairment,8659442,R21EY022200,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Aids', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Voice', 'base', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'tool development', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2014,230945,-0.06834350713596254
"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The co-robotic navigation aid and the related technology address a growing public health care issue -- visual impairment and target improving the life quality of the blind.

"Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inability to access information on printed signs directly impacts the mobility independence of the over 1.2 million blind persons in the U.S. Many previously proposed technological solutions to this problem either required physical modifications to the environment (talking signs or the placement of coded markers) or required the user to carry around specialized computational equipment, which can be stigmatizing. A recently pursued strategy is to utilize the computational capabilities of smart phones and techniques from computer vision to allow blind persons to read signs at a distance using commercially available, non-stigmatizing, smart- phones. However, despite the fact that sophisticated algorithms exist to recognize and extract sign text from cluttered video input (as evidenced, for example, by mapping services such as Google Maps automatically locating and blurring out only license plate text in street-view maps) current mobile solutions for reading sign text at a distance perform relatively poorly. This poor performance is largely because until recently, smart-phone processors have simply not been able to execute state-of-the-art computer vision text extraction and recognition algorithms at real-time rates, which forced previous mobile sign readers to utilize older, simplistic, less effective algorithms. Next-generation smart-phones run on fundamentally different, hybrid processor architectures (such as the Tegra 4, Snapdragon 800, both released in 2013) with dedicated embedded graphical processing units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs, which make them ideal for high-performance, vision-heavy computation. In this study, we propose to develop a smart-phone-based system for finding and reading signs at a distance which significantly outperforms previous such readers by implementing state-of-the-art text extraction algorithms on modern smart-phone hybrid GPU/CPU processor architectures. In Phase I, the proposed system will be developed and tested with blind users. In Phase II, feedback from user testing will be integrated into system design and the performance will be improved to permit operation in extremely challenging (such as low light) environments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 1.2 million people in the US are blind, and lack of safe and independent mobility substantially impacts the quality of life of this population. Printed textual signs, which are ubiquitously used in sighted navigation, are inaccessible to visually impaired persons, and this lack of access to environmental information contributes significantly to the mobility problem. This research would help develop a system whereby blind persons could use commercially available smart-phones to locate and read sign text at a distance.            ",Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices,8779810,R43EY024800,"['Acceleration', 'Access to Information', 'Algorithms', 'Antirrhinum', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Hybrids', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modification', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SKI gene', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'assistive device/technology', 'authority', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'next generation', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'volunteer']",NEI,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R43,2014,229742,0.05578490650340062

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8712492,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2014,368560,0.11380510139348801
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.

In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8656952,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2014,9945,-0.015105862264668903
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces  Title: Designing Visually Accessible Spaces NIH Program Announcement: 10-234 Bioengineering Research Partnerships (BRP)[R01] Abstract Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities, and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area). This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals: 1) Empirical: determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces. 2) Computational: develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces. 3) Deployment: translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility. The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare). We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8414506,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2013,59383,0.07845590194903015
"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Vision and Hearing Loss     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is estimated that by 2030, more than one in five people in the United States will be over the age of 65.  Age- related hearing and vision loss is considered a natural consequence of the aging process, yet current assistive technology approaches do little to address this type of sensory loss.  The proposed research will test the feasibility of incorporating visual information in hearing aids, which is expected to improve speech perception for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations, greatly enhancing their ability to lead independent lives, remain employable, and maintain active participation in society.                ",Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Vision and Hearing Loss,8443624,R21EY022200,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Aids', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Voice', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'tool development', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2013,198801,-0.06565595987765062
"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.           The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have. Transforming the camera into an intelligent visual sensor will lower the cost of assistance and improve the quality of life of the visually impaired community through increased independence and capabilities.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The co-robotic navigation aid and the related technology address a growing public health care issue -- visual impairment and target improving the life quality of the blind.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays. This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image. For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast. These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view. Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users. Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures. The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8579051,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,376082,0.11303230544513829
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.

"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8526929,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2013,53942,-0.015105862264668903
"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

FIVR, an active Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI) project, is a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. Version 1 of FIVR uses a mobile phoneÂ¿s embedded camera to capture a short video of food to be consumed. The food to be eaten is annotated verbally on the mobile phone by the user. These video and audio files are sent to a backend server for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. This project will develop specifications to extend FIVRÂ¿s capabilities to standardize, store, and analyze more diverse food images, such as 3D photos; to collect other food data; to enhance the analysis tools; and for interfaces to a variety of clinical/research systems. The FIVR Version 2 functional prototype will be developed to use 3D dietary images as input.

"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Summary As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his colaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specificaly examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.

Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  Â¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  Â¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  Â¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  Â¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,0.019015478700864515
"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his collaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specific examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind. The proposed research would investigate how computer vision object recognition technologies, which are now being implemented on mobile vision devices such as cell phones but are typically designed for normally sighted users, could be modified and harnessed to meet the special needs of blind and visually impaired persons.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.              The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,8037680,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,513228,0.04523617370397981

"Camera-based Text Recognition from Complex Backgrounds for the Blind or Visually There are more than 10 million blind and visually impaired people living in America today. Recent technology developments in computer vision, digital cameras, and portable computers make it possible to assist these individuals by developing camera-based products that combine computer vision technology with other existing products.  Although a number of reading assistants have been designed specifically for people who are blind or visually impaired, reading text from complex backgrounds or non-flat surfaces is very challenging and has not yet been successfully addressed. Many everyday tasks involve these challenging conditions, such as reading instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, instructions on medicine bottles or labels on soup cans.  This proposal focuses on the development of new computer vision algorithms to recognize text from complex backgrounds: 1) from backgrounds with multiple different colors (e.g .. the titles of books lined up on a shelf) and 2) from non-flat surfaces (e.g .. labels on medicine bottles or soup cans). The newly developed computer vision techniques will be integrated with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed by a portable computer (PDA or cell phone), while the speech display will be outputted via mini speakers, earphones, or Bluetooth device. A practical reading system prototype will be produced to read text from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces. The system will be cost-effective since it requires only a head mounted camera (<US$100 for 1M resolution), a wearable computer (<US$300), and two mini-speakers or earphones. The price of ""ReadIRlS"" [74] OCR software is under $150 and the ""TextAloud"" speech synthesis software is about $30 [75].  This project will be executed over two years at the City College of New York (CCNY) and Lighthouse International, New York. CCNY, located in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, is designated as both a Minority Institution and a Hispanic-serving Institution (37% Hispanic and 27% African American). Lighthouse International is a leading non-profit organization dedicated to preserving vision and to providing critically needed vision and rehabilitation services to help people of all ages overcome the challenges of vision loss. During the two years, we will 1) develop new algorithms to recognize text from backgrounds with multiple different colors; 2) develop new algorithms to recognize text from non-flat surfaces; and 3) develop a cost-effective prototype reading system for blind users by integrating with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. The effectiveness of the prototype and algorithms will be evaluated by people with normal vision and people with vision impairment. A database of text on complex backgrounds (multiple colors and non-flat surfaces) will be created for algorithm and system evaluation. The database will be made available to research communities in the areas of computer vision and vision rehabilitation science. In summary, this effort will provide a research-based foundation to inform the design of next generation reading assistants for blind persons, as well as produce a practical prototype to help the blind user read text from complex backgrounds in real-world environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of the proposed research is to develop new computer vision algorithms for camera-based text recognition from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces, as well as produce a practical reading system prototype in combination with off-the-shelf  optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products, to help blind or visually impaired people read instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, labels on medicine bottles or soup cans, etc. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed in realtime through a portable computer, such as a mini laptop or a personal digital assistant (PDA).

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7799708,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,427932,0.09604087213187452
"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7777764,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,527186,0.04523617370397981
"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team.

We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7586102,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'depressed', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,522802,0.04523617370397981
"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC.

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7446299,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Count', 'Custom', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'desire', 'image processing', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2008,421791,0.09604087213187452
"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         n/a",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,7316099,R01DC005241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Articulators', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nightmare', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research Design', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Sign Language', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Work', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'direct application', 'innovation', 'native American sign language', 'phonology', 'practical application', 'research study', 'syntax', 'teacher']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,476784,0.03829746752207146
"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7486800,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Optics', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2008,434041,0.042911587499586824

"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments.

"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7327116,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cataract', 'Clutterings', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'monocular', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2007,448477,0.042911587499586824
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7172766,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Range', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Models', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'concept', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,487230,0.04523617370397981
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         n/a",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,6985348,R01DC005241,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'communication behavior', 'communication disorder aid', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'information systems', 'paralinguistic behavior', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'sign language', 'video recording system', 'videotape /videodisc']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,2006,475410,0.03829746752207146
"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback.

"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,7096566,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,214738,0.08219892609748758
"Instrument development & fabrication for vision research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to enhance the research capabilities and collaborative efforts of the vision researchers at the Columbia University Medical Center.  State-of-the-art vision research often requires the custom fabrication of mechanical instruments to support the research. Support is requested for a single module to renovate and support the machine shop in the Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University, to be shared primarily between the Department of Ophthalmology and the Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior.  The module will have 10 users, 7 of whom have NEI-funded RO1 grants, and 3 of whom perform research in the area of visual systems neuroscience on grants funded by the NIMH. All of the investigators are also mentors on an NEI-funded training grant. The current systems projects include studies of the neurophysiology   and psychophysics of spatial vision, visual attention, early cortical processing, visual emotional association, and visual motion; the cellular and molecular projects include studies of fluid transport across corneal epithelium, retinal axon guidance, ocular wound healing, and the impact of the lipofuscin fluorophores on retinal pigmented epithelial cell function and viability. All of these projects require the development and fabrication of devices primarily designed for a given project. A great number of these can, when perfected, be shared among a number of projects. Examples of such devices include custom-made nanoliter injection devices, recording chambers, multiple-microdrive platforms, dual recording-iontophoretic devices, illumination devices, and recording gdds. The PI has extensive experience collaborating with machinists, and several of the devices in whose development he participated have been marketed commercially.  Currently the Department of Ophthalmology has a fully-equipped machine shop the machines of which are all fine old Bridgeport and Hardinge manual machines. This proposal is to upgrade the machine shop, with a computer-controlled lathe and a computer-controlled milling machine, and to support the salary of the machinist who was hired in June, 2003, using university startup funds. The availability of an in-house professionally certified machinist will significantly speed the process of design and fabrication of custom instruments.  The use of computer controlled machine tools will facilitate duplication of instruments usable in multiple laboratories.            n/a",Instrument development & fabrication for vision research,7057358,R24EY015634,"['biomedical equipment', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'neurosciences', 'vision']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R24,2006,180672,0.012193750276753923
"MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR we propose to demonstrate the technical feasibility of Mobile OCR, a portable software system which makes use of existing personal devices to provide access to textual materials for the elderly or the visually impaired. The system will help these low vision individuals with basic daily activities, such as shopping, preparing meals, taking medication, and reading traffic signs. It will step beyond our proposed MobileEyes vision enhancement system to apply cutting edge recognition technology for mobile devices. The system will use common camera phone hardware to capture and enhance textual information, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provide audio or visual feedback. Our research will focus on implementing and integrating new vision enhancement and analysis techniques on limited resource mobile devices. Specifically, we will develop algorithms for detection and rectification of text on planes and generalized cylinders subject to perspective distortions, implement more robust and efficient algorithms and systems for stabilization and enhancement of text blocks, provide mobile OCR on complex textured backgrounds, and implement these techniques on small devices across a variety of platforms. The recognized text will be presented through Text-to-Speech (TTS), or displayed on the device with enhanced quality which can be easily read by low vision users. Phase I will focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of our approach, and will incorporate a performance measurement methodology to quantitatively evaluate progress and evaluate our system against other approaches. In comparison to existing vision enhancement devices, such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, and text reading devices such as scanner-based OCR, our solution has several advantages: 1) it makes use of a single, portable device (camera cell phone) that is commonly available and typically already carried for its telecommunications capabilities; 2) it can be used selectively by users so they will not be overwhelmed by irrelevant information; and 3) it can be integrated directly with other applications for specialized tasks. Our research results will impact the millions of low-vision individuals and the blind, as well as vision and computer vision researchers. Our team is uniquely qualified to explore the feasibility of extending visual applications to these devices, and provide a platform for integrating future vision algorithms.         n/a",MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired,7053650,R43EY017216,"['reading', 'solutions', 'vision']",NEI,"APPLIED MEDIA ANALYSIS, LLC",R43,2006,104935,0.10228057688812776
"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000. Our price estimates are conservative, and we anticipate that the rapid development of computer technology will lower these costs substantially in the next few years.         n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,6995047,R43EY014487,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'digital imaging', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual fields', 'visual perception', 'visual threshold', 'visual tracking']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R43,2005,144106,0.11585157516038476

"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): Facial expression provides       sensitive cues about emotional response and plays a critical role in the             regulation of interpersonal behavior. Human-observer based methods for               measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to       standardize across laboratories and over time. To make feasible more rigorous,       quantitative measurement of facial expression in diverse applications, the           investigators formed an interdisciplinary research group that covers expertise       in facial expression analysis and computer vision. In August 1995, the research      group received initial funding for Facial Expression Analysis by Computer Image      Processing (NIMH #IRO1MH51435). With NIMH support, they created a large              representative database for method development and developed and validated a         face analysis system that tracks gaze and facial features in digitized image         sequences of infant, child, and adult subjects. In near frontal views, the Face      Analysis System has achieved concurrent validity with manual FACS coding for 16      of 44 FAGS action units and more than 30 combinations in which they occur. For       the competing renewal, the investigators will (1) Increase system robustness to      head orientation and head motion (2) Increase the number of recognizable action      units to include all 30 of those that have a specific anatomic basis, and (3)        Conduct a systematic, large-scale, comprehensive test of the developed Face          Analysis System by using multiple databases. These databases encompass subjects      of various ages and backgrounds and varying types of emotion induction, head         orientation, head motion, size of the face in pixels, and presence of speech.        The databases were initially collected to answer substantive questions about         emotion processes; they represent the types of data that the Face Analysis           System will encounter in psychology research and clinical applications. n/a",FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING,6881434,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'emotions', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'interpersonal relations', 'statistics /biometry', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2005,358843,0.053489727450989843

(2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,6920594,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2005,255198,0.08219892609748758
"Instrument development & fabrication for vision research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to enhance the research capabilities and collaborative efforts of the vision researchers at the Columbia University Medical Center.  State-of-the-art vision research often requires the custom fabrication of mechanical instruments to support the research. Support is requested for a single module to renovate and support the machine shop in the Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University, to be shared primarily between the Department of Ophthalmology and the Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior.  The module will have 10 users, 7 of whom have NEI-funded RO1 grants, and 3 of whom perform research in the area of visual systems neuroscience on grants funded by the NIMH. All of the investigators are also mentors on an NEI-funded training grant. The current systems projects include studies of the neurophysiology   and psychophysics of spatial vision, visual attention, early cortical processing, visual emotional association, and visual motion; the cellular and molecular projects include studies of fluid transport across corneal epithelium, retinal axon guidance, ocular wound healing, and the impact of the lipofuscin fluorophores on retinal pigmented epithelial cell function and viability. All of these projects require the development and fabrication of devices primarily designed for a given project. A great number of these can, when perfected, be shared among a number of projects. Examples of such devices include custom-made nanoliter injection devices, recording chambers, multiple-microdrive platforms, dual recording-iontophoretic devices, illumination devices, and recording gdds. The PI has extensive experience collaborating with machinists, and several of the devices in whose development he participated have been marketed commercially.  Currently the Department of Ophthalmology has a fully-equipped machine shop the machines of which are all fine old Bridgeport and Hardinge manual machines. This proposal is to upgrade the machine shop, with a computer-controlled lathe and a computer-controlled milling machine, and to support the salary of the machinist who was hired in June, 2003, using university startup funds.

"Core Grant for Vision Research The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute is a private non-profit organization, founded to encourage a productive collaboration between the clinical and basic research communities. To further this objective, the Institutes incorporates visual scientists from diverse medical and scientific backgrounds: ophthalmology visual scientific backgrounds. In the past, research at this Institute was focused on topics related to strabismus and amblyopia (oculomoter processing, binocular vision, cortical development of t he visual pathways). While these research areas are still growing, other distinct specialties have emerged in recent years Vision in the aging eye, motion and long-range processing, analysis of retinal functioning, retinal development, object recognition and computer vision are among the new research interests. Given the small scale of Smith-Kettlewell, the proximity of the scientists, and their common research interests, collaboration among scientist is an important aspect of the research milieu. Principal Investigators share resources with little difficulty. For more than twenty years, the Core Grant has formed the central component of the most important shared research services, chiefly electronic hardware design and maintenance, and computer communication and support. The technical expertise of our electronic and computer services group greatly benefits the rapid development of new research agendas-a tremendous advantage for new principal investigators and postdoctoral fellows, and a major factor in our high productivity. The Computer Services Module has evolved from providing predominantly software services in the past to establishing central computer services, including Internet, email, data transfer, central back-up and Intranet capabilities. We therefore are requesting renewal of these valuable Core Facilities.  n/a",Core Grant for Vision Research,6910762,P30EY006883,"['biomedical facility', 'health science research', 'vision']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2005,611743,0.03998825453131028
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.       Continuing our collaboration from Phase I, we use Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center's expertise for human factors. Bolton Engineering will design and build the proprietary device hardware. n/a",Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs,6739928,R44EY011821,"['assistive device /technology', 'blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'questionnaires']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2004,462571,0.08865680618676859
"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): Facial expression provides       sensitive cues about emotional response and plays a critical role in the             regulation of interpersonal behavior. Human-observer based methods for               measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to       standardize across laboratories and over time. To make feasible more rigorous,       quantitative measurement of facial expression in diverse applications, the           investigators formed an interdisciplinary research group that covers expertise       in facial expression analysis and computer vision. In August 1995, the research      group received initial funding for Facial Expression Analysis by Computer Image      Processing (NIMH #IRO1MH51435). With NIMH support, they created a large              representative database for method development and developed and validated a         face analysis system that tracks gaze and facial features in digitized image         sequences of infant, child, and adult subjects. In near frontal views, the Face      Analysis System has achieved concurrent validity with manual FACS coding for 16      of 44 FAGS action units and more than 30 combinations in which they occur. For       the competing renewal, the investigators will (1) Increase system robustness to      head orientation and head motion (2) Increase the number of recognizable action      units to include all 30 of those that have a specific anatomic basis, and (3)        Conduct a systematic, large-scale, comprehensive test of the developed Face          Analysis System by using multiple databases. These databases encompass subjects      of various ages and backgrounds and varying types of emotion induction, head         orientation, head motion, size of the face in pixels, and presence of speech.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         n/a",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,6733239,R01DC005241,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'communication behavior', 'communication disorder aid', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'information systems', 'paralinguistic behavior', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'sign language', 'video recording system', 'videotape /videodisc']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,2004,499766,0.03829746752207146
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6801171,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'cues', 'human subject', 'reading', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,329706,0.11879250889962045

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,0.02043582806810804

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000. Our price estimates are conservative, and we anticipate that the rapid development of computer technology will lower these costs substantially in the next few years.         n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,6580977,R43EY014487,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection', ' digital imaging', ' functional ability', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' medical rehabilitation related tag', ' patient oriented research', ' portable biomedical equipment', ' questionnaires', ' vision aid', ' vision disorders', ' visual fields', ' visual perception', ' visual threshold', ' visual tracking']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R43,2002,246164,0.11585157516038476
"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): Facial expression provides       sensitive cues about emotional response and plays a critical role in the             regulation of interpersonal behavior. Human-observer based methods for               measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to       standardize across laboratories and over time. To make feasible more rigorous,       quantitative measurement of facial expression in diverse applications, the           investigators formed an interdisciplinary research group that covers expertise       in facial expression analysis and computer vision. In August 1995, the research      group received initial funding for Facial Expression Analysis by Computer Image      Processing (NIMH #IRO1MH51435). With NIMH support, they created a large              representative database for method development and developed and validated a         face analysis system that tracks gaze and facial features in digitized image         sequences of infant, child, and adult subjects. In near frontal views, the Face      Analysis System has achieved concurrent validity with manual FACS coding for 16      of 44 FAGS action units and more than 30 combinations in which they occur. For       the competing renewal, the investigators will (1) Increase system robustness to      head orientation and head motion (2) Increase the number of recognizable action      units to include all 30 of those that have a specific anatomic basis, and (3)        Conduct a systematic, large-scale, comprehensive test of the developed Face          Analysis System by using multiple databases. These databases encompass subjects      of various ages and backgrounds and varying types of emotion induction, head         orientation, head motion, size of the face in pixels, and presence of speech.        The databases were initially collected to answer substantive questions about         emotion processes; they represent the types of data that the Face Analysis           System will encounter in psychology research and clinical applications. n/a",FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING,6538699,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' emotions', ' face expression', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' interpersonal relations', ' statistics /biometry', ' videotape /videodisc', ' visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2002,290602,0.053489727450989843
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired.

"COMPUTER VISION ANALYSIS OF DYNAMIC FACIAL BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Facial expressions provide an important behavioral measure for the study of emotion, cognitive processes, and social interaction, and contain diagnostic information for neurological disorders and depression. Facial expression measurement from video is less intrusive than EEG, EMO, ANS or brain imaging measurements as an indicator of emotional activity. The measurement is presently performed by human experts. The goal of this research is to develop an automatic system for recognition, measurement, and coding of facial expressions from video using computer vision technology. This project will utilize probabilistic models of dynamical systems to mod& the facial behavior underlying the observed image sequences. These techniques include hidden Markov models, and a new stochastic modeling technique developed by Movellan and colleagues called diffusion networks [38].

"RECOGNITION OF OBJECTS UNDER VARIABLE ILLUMINATION The goal of the proposed research is to develop and test a computational theory for the human ability to recognize objects under variable illumination (including extreme shadowing) and viewpoint changes. The ability to recognize objects is of fundamental importance in everyday life and the loss of this ability, due to a stroke or Alzheimer's disease, is a serious handicap to the person involved. The computational theory is based on a new paradigm for object representation --generative modeling - - in which an image-based model of an object is ""generated"" from a small set of training images. This theory has been demonstrated to successfully recognize objects from real images under extreme lighting variations. This gives a reality check on the theory and can be thought of as making it an ecological theory (in the sense that it yields good results on the types of images that humans encounter in the real world and not just on the visual stimuli occurring in laboratories). We have assembled a team of researchers with interdisciplinary skills in computer and biological vision. who will divide their efforts on the project based on their expertise.

"SIGN FINDER: COMPUTER VISION TO FIND AND READ SIGNS In this Phase l proposal we plan to develop and test a new vision technology to locat and read general informational signs (street names, building directories, office door plates) and location and directional signs (EXIT, Information, aisle signs in supermarkets). To strengthen feasibility, we will target a restricted class of signs: those consisting primarily of one- color text on a different one-color background, and whose shape falls within a prescribed set. The intended market is for people who are blind or whose sight is impaired and hence cannot read these signs unaided. Our approach makes extensive use of recently developed computer vision recognition algorithms. We also make use of the Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center's expertise for determining what the potential users will require from such a system. The ultimate goal, for Phase II, is to build and test a highly portable PC- based device implementing this vision technology using a CCD camera as input and a voice-generator as output. The user would scan/point the device at a scene and it would locate and read one or more signs. Given the pace of increase in power and decrease in size of computing devices, a hand-held Sign-Finder system may be plausible to build entirely with commercial, off-the-shelf hardware in two to three years.

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10019459,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,291252,0.03062232842229826
"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM â1.0â (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - â2.0â - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable âbehavioral databaseâ, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,0.030150815062028026

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the userâs location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the userâs location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the userâs trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9899994,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,416374,0.12049896054627313
"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on âfluoro huntingâ and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,10005337,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,204688,0.033256417098657724
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Abstract COVID-19 has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctorâs office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure. Accordingly, the goal of this COVID Supplement, which builds on and expands the work being conducted by the parent grant, is to develop a COVID map tool that provides fully accessible, non-visual access to maps. This tool will allow visually impaired persons to explore maps and preview routes from the comfort of their home, allowing them to plan their travel along safer, less congested routes using crowdedness data. In addition, the tool will present county-by-county COVID incidence data in a fully accessible form, which will inform their travel plans over greater distances. Thus, this project will give visually impaired persons the tools and confidence to undertake safer, more independent travel. Health Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic has an especially severe impact on people with significant vision impairments or blindness. The need for social distancing and reduced touching of oneâs surroundings has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctorâs office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure. These travel limitations may have adverse impacts on their physical and mental health.

"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.

"Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision ! Project Summary This application describes proposed research with the goal of facilitating use of a computer screen magnifier by people with low vision. Screen magnification is a well-established, popular technology for access of onscreen content. Its main shortcoming is that it requires the user to continuously control, with the mouse or trackpad, the location of the focus of magnification, in order to ensure that the magnified content of interest is within the screen viewport. This tedious process may be time-consuming and ineffective. For example, the simple task of reading the news on a web site requires continuous horizontal scrolling, which affects the experience of using this otherwise very beneficial technology, and may discourage its use, especially by those with poor manual coordination.  We propose to develop a software system that enables hands-free control of a screen magnifier. This system will rely on the userâs eye gaze (measured by a regular IR-based tracker, or from analysis of the images in a camera embedded in the screen) to update the location of the focus of magnification as desired. This research is inspired by preliminary work, which showed promising results with two simple gaze-based control algorithms, tested on three individuals with low vision.  This project will be a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz (PI: Manduchi, Co-I: Prado) and the School of Optometry at UC Berkeley (PI: Chung). Dr. Legge from the Department of Psychology at U. Minnesota will participate as a consultant. Two human subjects studies are planned. In Study 1 with 80 low vision subjects from four different categories of visual impairment, we will investigate the failure rate of a commercial gaze tracker (Aim 1), and will record mouse tracks, gaze tracks, and images from the subjects while performing a number of tasks using two modalities of screen magnification (Aim 2). In Study 2, with the same number of subjects, we will repeat the Study 1 experiment, but using a gaze-based controller trained from the data collected in Study 1, and individually tunable for best performance (Aim 3). In addition, we will experiment with an appearance-based gaze tracker that uses images from the screen camera, thereby removing the need for specialized gaze tracking hardware, as well as with a computer tablet form factor (Aim 4). We expect that reading speed and error rate using our gaze-based controller will be no worse than using mouse-based control. If successful, this study will show that the convenience of hands-free control offered by the proposed system comes at no additional cost in terms of individual performance at the considered tasks. ! ! Project Narrative People with low vision often use screen magnification software to read on a computer screen. Since a magnifier expands the screen content beyond the physical size of the screen (the âviewportâ), it is necessary to move the content using the mouse so that the portion of interest falls within the viewport. This project will facilitate use of a screen magnifier by means of a new software system that relies on the userâs own gaze to control scrolling when reading with magnification. !",Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision,10053172,R01EY030952,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Apple', 'Behavior Control', 'Benchmarking', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desktop Video', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magic', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Mus', 'Operating System', 'Optometry', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computer science', 'control trial', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gaze', 'human subject', 'interest', 'motor control', 'news', 'recurrent neural network', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'tool', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2020,350753,0.06746393578626071
