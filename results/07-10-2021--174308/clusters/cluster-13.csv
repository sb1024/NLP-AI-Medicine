"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9952362,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47875,117374875,0.08880089090700448
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,8428162,0.07529547795963261
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators. This computational approach will be validated using in vitro testing and offers several advantages to identify potential novel or repurposed molecules as MCM including speed and cost-effectiveness.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,10094026,R43ES031038,"['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Ache', 'Address', 'Adenosine', 'Adenosine A1 Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chlorine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Licensing', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Privatization', 'PubChem', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'computational toxicology', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'novel', 'pesticide poisoning', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary agents', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,124915,280601,0.06081949294873612
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,81181560,0.0996950968859503
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9857604,R01GM108340,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'virtual screening', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,313000,570146095,0.08904690054061948
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9872178,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,314000,560644462,0.02940665840696912
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9935079,R01GM081871,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,354744,113554200,0.014737276995931121
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,982577,0.047239186958115825
"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",9885647,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'genetic profiling', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,480849,685608202,0.04565609572804244
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,77336088,0.01898258892962267
"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining time-dependent infrared spectroscopy to determine the Mode of Action (MOA) of various compounds, including apoptosis- inducing cytotoxic compounds as well as kinase inhibitors. We will develop new hardware for laser-based micro- spectroscopy.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context.

"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9846198,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,1140875,76545728,0.07052891615194315
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,185946435,0.04749082746634259
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,377931988,-0.006312263081955674
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic

validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9732293,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,31648,117374875,0.08880089090700448
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9995278,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CXCL11 gene', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,64234,81181560,0.0996950968859503
"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescein', 'Glucuronides', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Products', 'Online Systems', 'Organic Cation Transporter', 'Output', 'POU2F2 gene', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'software development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'uptake']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,280601,0.061513281971277395
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,9694695,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual', 'virtual technology']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,235391,68045551,0.06908570868680174
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9720905,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,291940,81181560,0.0996950968859503
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,77336088,0.01898258892962267
"A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data Human monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing therapeutic modalities, with over sixty compounds approved by FDA to treat infections, autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In combination, these diseases are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people annually, according to the World Health Organization. However, the advent of therapeutic immunologics is expected to significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality, particularly for oncologic diseases. Currently, 15 immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments are commercially available and comprise a growing market that is expected to reach $100B by 2022. IO therapeutics effectively attack cancer by selectively binding tumor-specific protein domains on the cell surface, referred to as tumor-associated ectodomains (TAEs). However, many cancers remain insensitive to available IO as effective and safe TAEs are difficult to identify. Standard methods to detect TAEs are costly, time-consuming and limited in their ability to discover novel targets, necessitating the development of innovative technologies to circumvent this burden. RNAseq is currently the most effective method to discover novel splicing isoforms, is high-throughput, sensitive and inexpensive. Envisagenics has been at the forefront of RNAseq- based splicing characterization since the release of its SpliceCore® platform. Here, we propose to develop SpliceIO, a novel drug discovery platform that integrates the Envisagenics’ SpliceCore knowledge base with machine learning algorithms to enable rapid identification of aberrant splicing-derived TAEs using RNAseq data. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will develop and apply SpliceIO in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a cancer particularly resistant to IO but highly associated with splicing mis-regulation and mutations within key spliceosome components. We will identify and validate TAEs in vitro using established leukemia cell lines and patient-derived bone marrow aspirates in collaboration with Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Collectively, the aims outlined herein will allow us to both develop and validate a novel splicing-dependent TAE identification platform to provide new sources of drug targets while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with their development. In addition, this will allow Envisagenics to create new partnership opportunities for IO co- development with pharmaceutical companies. If successful, this pipeline can be used to identify drug targets and/or biomarkers for patient stratification in cancer and inflammatory diseases in the context of an SBIR Phase II grant. Despite the recent success of immune-based treatments in melanoma, the majority of cancers remain insensitive and resistant to therapy, necessitating the development of approaches to rapidly identify novel drug targets. Here, we propose to build a target discovery platform that combines our proprietary database of RNA splicing mutations in cancers with machine learning to identify the most clinically-relevant targets for subsequent drug development.",A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data,9909639,R43CA246950,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Databases', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor-Derived', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immunogenic', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,301502,0,0.03156934160248243
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9634985,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,313000,570146095,0.08904690054061948
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,560644462,0.02940665840696912
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9700682,R01GM081871,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,354744,113554200,0.014737276995931121
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,8428162,0.07529547795963261
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9751326,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Industry Standard', 'Intelligence', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'computational suite', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,692845,280601,0.08672044482055816
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9608807,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'robotic system', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2019,754441,1905060,0.06580580363383452
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9640405,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,1140875,76545728,0.07052891615194315
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,185946435,0.04749082746634259

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9607906,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Hospitalization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,31156,117374875,0.08880089090700448
"Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets PROJECT SUMMARY Drugs act by altering the activities of particular components (targets) within a cell or organism. Thus, drug discovery campaigns begin by identifying a target, followed by screening this target with compounds to identify leads that can be developed into a drug. Unfortunately, identifying effective drug targets for a given disease, let alone for individual patients (e.g. in highly heterogeneous cancers) is an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. As a result, drugs are frequently developed against incorrect or suboptimal targets, and end up showing no clinical efficacy. Powerful genomic technologies have paved the way for much of the modern understanding of molecular biology, but they have not proven efficient at identifying drug targets. Phenotypic screening, which identifies efficacious drugs by screening compounds directly on cells, has thus regained popularity. In phenotypic screening, however, the targets are typically unknown. We are developing an innovative biotechnology platform that directly identifies effective pharmacological targets from cellular disease models by combining the two approaches, target- based and phenotypic-based screening. This is accomplished with the use of a highly annotated chemical library and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The compounds are screened in a cell-based assay, and the phenotypic readouts are analyzed in relation to the compounds’ biochemical activities, revealing the candidate targets that are mediating the therapeutic activity of effective compounds. This approach can one day be applied at the patient level, for example using patient-derived cancer cells. We have focused our proof of concept studies on the kinase family of drug targets, and hypothesize that our platform can identify kinase dependencies in cancer cells that cannot otherwise be identified using transcriptomic and whole exome sequencing data. The aims of this Phase I application are to 1) deploy our platform to identify novel kinase targets in DLBCL Lymphoma, and 2) identify kinase inhibitors that could be used to build a compound library that optimizes the performance of the platform. Innovative features of the platform include the combination of target- and phenotypic-based screening, the machine learning algorithm that efficiently detects targets as well as anti-targets, the cell-based screening strategy which uses both tumor and normal cells to detect cancer-specific cytotoxicity, and the unique design features of the compound library. The platform will enable rapid target identification in any area of disease where a clinically relevant cell-based model exists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, the cost of developing new drugs has skyrocketed. A major culprit is the difficulty in identifying cellular components that can be engaged by drugs to produce a therapeutic effect. This proposal has two main aims: 1) The first aim is to demonstrate that by using computer algorithms to combine biochemical- and cellular- screening data, effective drug targets can be identified for two different subtypes of DLBCL lymphoma. Importantly, the method also identifies off-targets that, if disturbed, will counteract the desired outcome (i.e. lower or neutralize a drug’s efficacy). The method uses normal blood cells from healthy donors to ensure that the identified drug targets serve to specifically abolish cancer cells without harming normal cells. These key features make our method a valuable complement for currently used target identification technologies, including genomics and proteomics. 2) The second aim is to develop the core components of the methodology into a robust and standalone platform that can be used by drug discovery programs at Truvitech, its partners, and its clients. !",Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets,9553172,R41TR002293,"['Adult Lymphoma', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Client', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Promega', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cellular targeting', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic manipulation', 'genomic platform', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lead optimization', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCATS,"TRUVITECH, LLC",R41,2018,224804,0,0.05236696704639445
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,81181560,0.0996950968859503
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,77336088,0.01898258892962267
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9419924,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,312167,570146095,0.08904690054061948
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public.

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design,9545018,R01GM122845,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'pathogen genome', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'small molecule', 'structural genomics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2018,343028,17295825,0.05222102127236774
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these developing emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for “data-driven” drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. A pioneering project and dataset for D4 is the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. Though with many successes, the Connectivity Map is based on only a single biomolecule type, RNA, and downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and metabolites are ignored. In this proposal, we combine the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput compound screening platform. Our preliminary data for two major drugs (doxorubicin and rapamycin) showcases that our approach has technical validity, accuracy, and provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approaches. This Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics-based screening platform. First, we will profile ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes. Second, we will develop the necessary bioinformatics pipelines, mechanistic metabolic models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these complex datasets. Finally, we will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the Connectivity Map boosts D4 predictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actions, compound similarity, identifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safety, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities. After the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase I, Phase II will focus on profiling of novel chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we will build a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in disease. This proposal will test the viability of this approach and focus on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,9621965,R43GM130268,"['Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doxorubicin', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'MCF7 cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'base', 'cell growth', 'chemical genetics', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,442427,754478,0.048661307846619026
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9464228,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,744321,1905060,0.06580580363383452
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9485464,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,1436141,76545728,0.07052891615194315
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,185946435,0.04749082746634259
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

have discovered potent antimicrobial activities of existing antibiotics against highly “drug­resistant superbugs”  that are currently ignored but revealed in synergy with the human immune system. This program proposes a

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties. The approach will also have high value for drug repurposing efforts and identifying new compounds for targets with creation of new IP in our own research on neglected and rare diseases and in the laboratories of customers.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9254390,R43GM122196,"['Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Excretory function', 'Fingerprint', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'absorption', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'frontier', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'neglect', 'open data', 'open source', 'research and development', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2017,149999,280601,0.07640809334949503
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,9325031,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,293344,511185245,0.06908570868680174
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9235506,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,309750,570146095,0.08904690054061948
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design,9285997,R01GM122845,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data integration', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'pathogen genome', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'small molecule', 'structural genomics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2017,354226,17295825,0.05222102127236774
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9384431,R01GM081871,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,422166,113554200,0.014737276995931121
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation

"Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like liver X receptor (LXR) β selective agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent work demonstrated that activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid β (Aβ) turnover, reduction in Aβ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic LXRβ selective binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or binding to undesired targets. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity, brain penetration potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes. A dozen diverse compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays, dose-response studies and more detailed, sophisticated, and mechanistic assays during Phase 2. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biological assays will identify drug-like LXRβ selective agonists with minimal side-effects.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.        ",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,8858750,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Planning Techniques', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,293344,511185245,0.06908570868680174
"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,8917490,0.024242985333949557

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies.

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types. Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy. In this grant, we propose to: develop RPS19 and RPS10 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes ('phenoprints') using our drug discovery platform; conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on-target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS19 and RPS10; expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non-adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD34+ suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds arising from the project. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disease for which no targeted therapy exists. Loss of function in RPS19 and RPS10, or other ribosomal protein genes, results in the disease.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8934076,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2015,915977,8428162,0.06181642062368043
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,8428162,0.06181642062368043
"Novel Paradigms For Drug Discovery: Computational Multitarget Screening DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies. The resulting computer simulated models will support major advancements in drug discovery for human health, animal health and related research.            ",Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering,8781169,R44GM100520,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Time', 'Work', 'Yang', 'antibody engineering', 'anticancer research', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'glycosylation', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'screening', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"DNASTAR, INC.",R44,2014,746428,2499981,0.02081163220412285
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.          We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis. We will demonstrate the utility of the tool (available also as a mobile application) and overall workflow ourselves by discovering and developing compounds for TB and other infectious diseases.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.              Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research strategy is to target ApoE gene expression through RXR agonists; this has recently been shown to improve A¿ turnover, reduction in A¿ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic RXR binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biochemical assays including competitive binding with bexarotene, and ApoE level determination in cultured mouse brain cells. A small number of drug-like compounds will be obtained through multiple iterations of the two steps of in-silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biochemical assays will identify drug-like compounds that can clear toxic chemicals responsible for Alzheimer's Disease from brain cells with minimal side-effects.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS). By so doing, the rate of discovery of drugs to treat this global tropical disease will be increased.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis. We will demonstrate the utility of the tool (available also as a mobile application) and overall workflow ourselves by discovering and developing compounds for TB and other infectious diseases.              We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD).

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

"High Throughput Screen for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. The molecular basis of DM1 is the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the protein kinase gene, DMPK. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that alter the biology of CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal transcript. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of over a million compounds. An initial screen of 2,500 small molecules from this library resulted in the identification of a potent lead compound, MDI16, which reverses aberrant RNA splice patterns in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in the HSALR mouse model for DM1. In a concerted effort to identify other potent lead compounds we propose the following: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay in the MLPCN center. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary cell-based assays to identify highly potent molecules that reverse four key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Aim 3. Characterize the selectivity and toxicity of lead compounds and identify their mechanism of action at the cellular level using a set of cell-based assays developed in the lab. Aim 4. In conjunction with the MLPCN center, we will refine the chemical structure of lead compounds reiteratively to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure. Over the past few years exciting strides in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of this disorder have been made. Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy. Currently we have discovered potent molecules, which rescue DM1 pathology in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in DM1 mouse models. As our screens have been proven to identify potent molecules that rescue DM1 pathology, in this application we propose to identify other lead compounds by screening the MLPCN chemical library with our HTS. Identification of multiple leads will greatly improve the probability of a small molecule therapy for DM1.           Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,8019584,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2011,98010,7249069,0.003810519772824421
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7753228,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2010,98700,7249069,0.003810519772824421
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any disease, thereby increasing the suc       n/a",NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING,7979181,DP1OD006779,"['Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Award', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Excretory function', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'absorption', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP1,2010,830000,533302350,0.11342765534987763
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7850408,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,26557,50305751,0.056641783306920525
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7559157,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2009,98400,7249069,0.003810519772824421
"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline.

"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models.

"Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed work is to continue developing novel descriptors and informatics/statistical methods that will serve as the building blocks of evolving predictive ADME-toxicology, ADMET, tools, which are accurate, reliable and applicable across a wide diversity of chemistry. The two classes of descriptors being developed are semi-structure based properties from the membrane-interaction [Ml]- QSAR paradigm, and the universal 4D-fingerprint descriptors coming from the 4D-QSAR paradigm. Each class of descriptors has been shown to both enhance the quality of resultant predictive ADMET models when used with 'traditional' descriptors, as well as to lead to significant predictive ADMET models when the 'traditional' descriptors fail in model construction. Moreover, the MI-QSAR descriptors can provide mechanistic information regarding those ADMET properties which involve the interaction of a compound with the membrane of a cell as is the case, for example, for blood-brain barrier penetration. The 4D-fingerprints explicitly contain the 3D conformational distribution information of a molecule. Once computed these descriptors can be stored and subsequently used in any predictive ADMET application. The 4D-fingerpints also provide a general set of molecular features that allow the meaningful estimation of ligand-protein binding, including serum proteins, based on the concept that similar ligands bind in a similar fashion to a common protein. Cluster and categorical statistical methods are to be developed as 'preprocessors' in the building of reliable manifold models from structurally diverse training sets, and the subsequent virtual screening of structurally diverse compounds.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7471355,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,411777,50305751,0.056641783306920525
"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents. Our automated cognitive testing system for mice will provide superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput than standard cognitive tests and, with its power to screen libraries in vivo, will discover novel compounds with efficacy in cognition.         n/a",Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers,7169555,R43MH076342,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Basic Behavioral Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mouse Strains', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nootropic Agents', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Somatotype', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2007,199963,8428162,0.05803698902483166
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7214118,R42ES013321,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'End Point', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'highly advanced system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'subtraction hybridization', 'tool']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2007,257269,0,0.03525287242519182
"Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed work is to continue developing novel descriptors and informatics/statistical methods that will serve as the building blocks of evolving predictive ADME-toxicology, ADMET, tools, which are accurate, reliable and applicable across a wide diversity of chemistry. The two classes of descriptors being developed are semi-structure based properties from the membrane-interaction [Ml]- QSAR paradigm, and the universal 4D-fingerprint descriptors coming from the 4D-QSAR paradigm. Each class of descriptors has been shown to both enhance the quality of resultant predictive ADMET models when used with 'traditional' descriptors, as well as to lead to significant predictive ADMET models when the 'traditional' descriptors fail in model construction. Moreover, the MI-QSAR descriptors can provide mechanistic information regarding those ADMET properties which involve the interaction of a compound with the membrane of a cell as is the case, for example, for blood-brain barrier penetration. The 4D-fingerprints explicitly contain the 3D conformational distribution information of a molecule. Once computed these descriptors can be stored and subsequently used in any predictive ADMET application. The 4D-fingerpints also provide a general set of molecular features that allow the meaningful estimation of ligand-protein binding, including serum proteins, based on the concept that similar ligands bind in a similar fashion to a common protein. Cluster and categorical statistical methods are to be developed as 'preprocessors' in the building of reliable manifold models from structurally diverse training sets, and the subsequent virtual screening of structurally diverse compounds.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,0,0.056641783306920525
"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,0,0.003185023697206946
"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II.

"Highthroughput analysis of behavior for CNS applications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to the NIMH research topic, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation. The goal of this project is to alleviate the bottleneck in psychiatric drug and target discovery and characterization of novel mutants by using our expertise in behavioral pharmacology in mice to develop Smart cube, an automated high-throughput system of behavioral, neurological and physiological analysis. Smart cube will comprise innovative robotic-like hardware, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral and physiological states.

Smart cube will facilitate current behavioral research, drug discovery, target validation and fast characterization of mutant mice from target gene manipulation and mutagenesis efforts. Phase I of this Fast Track proposal will develop SmartCube to automatically classify mouse behavior, to characterize the behavioral response of inbred strains of mice under the influence of different pharmacological interventions covering anxiolytic and antipsychotic drugs and to develop an integrated non-invasive ECG in unrestrained mice, which will run simultaneously with the automated analysis of behavior.
