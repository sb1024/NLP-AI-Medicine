"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,10005582,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,188226,178185562,0.18786127694791088
"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD",10054894,K23MH121650,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional disorder', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'atomoxetine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'sustained attention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational clinical trial', 'treatment response']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,560644462,0.018184468935676417
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,685608202,0.0392397843639247
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,161094826,0.07702160700935275
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4.

Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,161094826,0.07740096406772082
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9743874,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'decision making algorithm', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,176167,304670088,0.10931501146501588
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,9725011,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,297059,533594881,0.18786127694791088

Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9743884,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,623653,146629556,0.06410660096148377
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,161094826,0.07740096406772082
"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9529387,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192351,304670088,0.10931501146501588
"LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms. Project Summary / Abstract ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood, affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings. LemurDx is a concept for a software system for smartwatches and mobile tablets, optimized for clinical use, that uses state-of-the-art, yet relatively low-cost, sensor technology to measure hyperactivity, with the clinical goal of differentiating children with ADHD-hyperactive presentation or ADHD combined presentation from children with typical levels of activity. LemurDx will passively collect data from smartwatch sensors. Clinicians will ask a child to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx application for one day and then collect the de-identified data. The data will be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant secure server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to differentiate children with clinical levels of hyperactivity from those with typical levels of activity, providing clinicians with immediate results. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number of ways. Along with the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors (many of which are not available on actigraphy devices) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the team is carefully designing a complete system based on the unique needs of clinicians. This includes a comprehensive system of secure HIPAA-compliant servers, automated state-of-the- art ML algorithms, pre-programmed mobile tablets and smartwatches for clinical use, a secure and de- identified data architecture, and a simple user interface that eliminates any technological burden on clinicians. Aim 1 of the project is to develop a commercial grade prototype of LemurDx following principles of user- centered design, with feedback from focus groups including children, parents, and clinicians. Aim 2 of the project is to test the feasibility of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from 30 children (ages 6-11) who will wear a smartwatch with LemurDx technology for one day. Aim 3 of the project is to test and refine several ML algorithms to achieve a high level of sensitivity and specificity to accurately classify children with and without ADHD. LemurDx is significant as there is no objective and commercially available measure of hyperactivity to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, despite a great need in settings including pediatric primary-care practices, children’s hospitals, and behavioral health clinics. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure, “that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Innovations include a combination of reliable, inexpensive measurement technology combined with accurate ML algorithms to consistently and objectively measure hyperactivity in a system that is designed for clinical users. We will show that LemurDx has commercialization potential by demonstrating accuracy, cost effectiveness, and user adherence, and will lay the foundation for the development of a scalable clinical delivery system. Project Narrative ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood affecting around 5% of all American children.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta.

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal. Completing the proposed project will enable the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in the fields of clinical and developmental cognitive neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and is characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive control. This project seeks to uncover dynamic brain mechanisms underlying two different types of cognitive control and their relation to clinical symptoms associated with childhood ADHD.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,146629556,0.06410660096148377
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9242756,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2016,76750,2132449,0.0874297775138219
"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children.

"Dynamic Brain Mechanisms of Proactive and Reactive Control in Childhood ADHD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application under the NIH K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award Mechanism. The overall goal of the research project is to understand brain mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control and their relation to individual differences in behavioral symptoms associated with childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Childhood ADHD is characterized by significant impairments in academic and social domains, and deficits in cognitive control are at the core of these impairments. Recent research suggests that cognitive control operates via two distinct modes: proactive and reactive. However, the extent to which proactive and reactive control processes influence behavioral symptoms associated with ADHD remains unknown. This proposal will address this fundamental question by assessing how imaging-defined constructs for proactive and reactive control affect inattention and impulsivity in children with and without ADHD using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy.  The candidate will use a novel systems neuroscience approach to investigate dynamic brain mechanisms of proactive and reactive control in children and their relation to symptoms associated with ADHD. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To investigate dynamic causal interactions in brain networks during reactive and proactive control in children, (2) To investigate how aberrant dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control affect impulsivity and inattention in children using the RDoC approach, (3) To examine whether dynamic causal interactions during reactive and proactive control can differentiate children with clinically diagnosed ADHD from typically-developing children, and (4) To explore biomarkers for symptom prediction and classification using multivariate imaging-defined constructs of reactive and proactive control. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of fundamental brain mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognitive control in children with and without ADHD. It will also advance the use of new computational tools in clinical neuroscience research and provide a systems neuroscience framework for future studies of cognitive control in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education and training plan to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ADHD research, advanced brain network analyses and machine learning algorithms for symptom prediction. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, brain network analyses and machine learning. The candidate will also gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ADHD. Formal coursework and attendance at seminars in psychology, psychiatry, connectomics and machine learning will assist in achieving this goal.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9177860,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skills Development', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'response', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,180850,304670088,0.10931501146501588
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,146629556,0.06410660096148377

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,146629556,0.06410660096148377

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.         PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.

"Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than one million deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates using novel approaches, especially for mothers and infants who represent key target groups. Dr. Michelow's research goal for the proposed Mentored Career Development Award is to discover new anti-malarial vaccines for women of childbearing age in order to protect their highly vulnerable offspring from severe or fatal malaria in early infancy. Under the mentorship of Drs. Kurtis and Friedman from Brown University, and Drs. Duffy and Fried from the NIH/NIAID Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology, who are internationally renowned investigators, he plans to test the hypothesis that novel vaccine targets can be discovered by identifying transplacentally acquired malarial antibodies that mediate infants' resistance to severe or fatal malaria. The objective of this proposal is to identify conserved Plasmodium falciparum antigens that are uniquely recognized by IgG antibodies in venous blood obtained at delivery from mothers whose infants survived their first year of life with mild or no clinical malaria, but that are not recognized by IgG antibodies from mothers whose infants suffered severe disease or death due to malaria. Dr. Michelow's team will capitalize on plasma samples and epidemiological data that they already collected from a large well-characterized longitudinal cohort in Muheza, Tanzania (n=739). In order to achieve these objectives, they propose three Specific Aims that are directed at 1) discovering, 2) validating and 3) downselecting P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens. The strength of this patient-oriented translational strategy derives from the fact that they will use plasma of mothers and infants with naturally acquired malarial antibodies at the earliest stage of vaccine epitope discovery. Based on the successful approach pioneered by Dr. Kurtis, they will perform a differential high throughput whole proteome screen on select groups of pooled plasma from mothers of infants with severe malaria vs. mothers of infants with mild or no malaria. They will use a newly produced P. falciparum (3D7) malaria genomic DNA T7 phage display library as well as a wild type blood-stage complementary DNA T7 phage library for this purpose. Candidate vaccine antigens will then be validated by testing a large independent cohort of mothers and infants from the same population to determine which specific malarial antibodies most reliably predict better malaria outcomes. They will employ mixed effects logistic regression modeling to account for repeated measures and confounding variables as well as the Cox proportional hazards survival model to compare time to predefined endpoints. Lead candidate antigens will then be downselected using bioinformatics and surface localization studies, as well as functional evaluations, using invasion and growth inhibition assays for blood stage candidates. Dr. Michelow's previous clinical training in Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, his research on diagnostic tests for children with pneumonia or congenital syphilis, and his laboratory work on production of novel immunotherapeutics for glycosylated virus infections, have laid a solid foundation for his proposed research project. Under the guidance of his mentors, he will bridge the gap between basic science and patient-oriented research by applying rigorous, mechanistic and creative methods of enquiry to translate basic science concepts into relevant human interventions and therapies. He plans to accomplish his goals by acquiring critical new skills in the following three key areas: 1) vaccine immunology, 2) advanced molecular methods, and 3) applied biostatistics, epidemiology and human population research. Specifically, he will be trained in methods to implement innovative phage-based molecular screening strategies, select and test optimal malaria vaccine epitopes, cultivate and genetically manipulate malaria parasites, perform cell-based infection assays, interrogate the malaria genome/proteome databases, use sophisticated cell imaging technologies, model complex data using advanced statistical methods to account for confounding variables and repeated measures, and reinforce importance of bioethical issues. The proposed research experiences will prepare Dr. Michelow to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming a skilled investigator in hypothesis-driven translational research in the field of malaria vaccine discovery. One or more rationally identified lead candidate vaccine epitopes from the current proposal will form the basis of his R01 application. His objectives will be to 1) confirm the relevance of the antigen/s derived from native P. falciparum strains from Tanzania, 2) conduct animal studies to study effectiveness and mechanisms of action of new vaccines, and 3) establish a Phase I healthy human volunteer vaccine study. Dr. Michelow and his team of highly accomplished investigators are committed to the mission of developing new effective malaria vaccines using creative strategies.          PROJECT NARRATIVE: Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes the highest mortality in African children. This research aims to develop an effective new malaria vaccine to protect infants by taking advantage of maternal antibodies that cross the placenta. Candidate vaccine proteins will be screened, confirmed and selected for clinical trials using pioneering molecular tools and blood samples from pregnant African women and their infants.                ",Vaccine Development for Falciparum Malaria in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring,8508595,K08AI100997,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Bacteriophages', 'Basic Science', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blood typing procedure', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Commit', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Syphilis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'In Vitro', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Maternal antibody', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Pregnant Women', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Tanzania', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tropical Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Venous', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'hazard', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant death', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'offspring', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'pregnant', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K08,2013,155064,37921345,0.1864118435989512
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems.

"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD). The long-term research goal of this project continues to be the identification of genetics factors which predispose to the development and course of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The immediate goal of the current application is to test the discriminant validity of DSM-IV and latent class conceptualizations of ADHD subtypes on the stability, course and outcome of illness. During the initial funding period of this project we have developed an alternative DSM-IV nosology using latent class analysis. In contrast to DSM-IV ADHD subtypes, these new phenotypes appear to be genetically independent forms of ADHD. These studies utilized birth defects based identification of twins with ADHD symptomatology through a two-stage screening process.  In this current application we propose to conduct a 5- year follow-up study of 450 families identified through having a latent class or DSM-IV identified ADHD subtype. In addition to repeating the original evaluation assessment, families will also complete an enhanced set of interviews and questionnaires relating to family history, home environment and outcome measures. In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6819975,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', 'behavioral genetics', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'genetic models', 'genetic screening', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'mental health epidemiology', 'patient oriented research', 'questionnaires', 'twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,546341,533594881,0.11049985689166725

"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD). The long-term research goal of this project continues to be the identification of genetics factors which predispose to the development and course of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The immediate goal of the current application is to test the discriminant validity of DSM-IV and latent class conceptualizations of ADHD subtypes on the stability, course and outcome of illness. During the initial funding period of this project we have developed an alternative DSM-IV nosology using latent class analysis. In contrast to DSM-IV ADHD subtypes, these new phenotypes appear to be genetically independent forms of ADHD. These studies utilized birth defects based identification of twins with ADHD symptomatology through a two-stage screening process.  In this current application we propose to conduct a 5- year follow-up study of 450 families identified through having a latent class or DSM-IV identified ADHD subtype. In addition to repeating the original evaluation assessment, families will also complete an enhanced set of interviews and questionnaires relating to family history, home environment and outcome measures. In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6436955,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', ' behavioral genetics', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' family genetics', ' genetic models', ' genetic screening', ' human subject', ' longitudinal human study', ' mental health epidemiology', ' patient oriented research', ' questionnaires', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,613405,533594881,0.11049985689166725
